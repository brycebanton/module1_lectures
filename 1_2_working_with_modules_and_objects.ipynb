The\\r\\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\\r\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\\r\\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\\r\\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\r\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Single, my dear, to be sure!  A single man of large\\r\\nfortune; four or five thousand a year.  What a fine thing for our\\r\\ngirls!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?  How can it affect them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so\\r\\n tiresome!  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying\\r\\none of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Design!  Nonsense, how can you talk so!  But it is very likely\\r\\nthat he MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\r\\nmust visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see no occasion for that.  You and the girls may go, or you\\r\\nmay send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still\\r\\nbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley\\r\\nmay like you the best of the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, you flatter me.  I certainly HAVE had my share of\\r\\nbeauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\r\\nWhen a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give\\r\\nover thinking of her own beauty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think\\r\\nof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when\\r\\nhe comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But consider your daughters.  Only think what an\\r\\nestablishment it would be for one of them.  Sir William and\\r\\nLady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for\\r\\nin general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you\\r\\nmust go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do\\r\\nnot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely.  I dare say Mr. Bingley will\\r\\nbe very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\r\\nassure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\r\\nchooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for\\r\\n my little Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not a bit better\\r\\nthan the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\r\\nJane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\r\\ngiving HER the preference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied\\r\\nhe; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\r\\nsomething more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a\\r\\nway?  You take delight in vexing me.  You have no compassion\\r\\nfor my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for your\\r\\nnerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you mention\\r\\nthem with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic\\r\\nhumour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-\\r\\ntwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand\\r\\nhis character.  HER mind was less difficult to develop.  She was\\r\\na woman of mean understanding, little information, and\\r\\nuncertain temper.  When she was discontented, she fancied\\r\\nherself nervous.  The business of her life was to get her\\r\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\r\\nalways assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\r\\nevening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.  It\\r\\nwas then disclosed in the following manner: --Observing his\\r\\nsecond daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly\\r\\naddressed her with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes,\" said\\r\\nher mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet\\r\\nhim at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.  She has two\\r\\nnieces of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\r\\nhave no opinion of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that\\r\\nyou do not depend on her serving you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to\\r\\ncontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\\'s sake!  Have a little\\r\\ncompassion on my nerves.  You tear them to pieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she\\r\\ntimes them ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\\r\\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come\\r\\nback till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to\\r\\nintroduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\r\\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\r\\nwith him myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is\\r\\ncertainly very little.  One cannot know what a man really is by\\r\\nthe end of a fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else\\r\\nwill; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their\\r\\nchance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if\\r\\nyou decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\r\\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried\\r\\nhe.  \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress\\r\\nthat is laid on them, as nonsense?  I cannot quite agree with you\\r\\nTHERE. What say you, Mary?  For you are a young lady of\\r\\ndeep reflection, I know, and read great books and make\\r\\nextracts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that\\r\\nbefore?  If I had known as much this morning I certainly would\\r\\nnot have called on him.  It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\r\\npaid the visit; we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first\\r\\ntumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\r\\nhad expected all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!  But I knew I\\r\\nshould\\r\\npersuade you at last.  I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\r\\nneglect such an acquaintance.  Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\r\\nsuch a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning\\r\\nand never said a word about it till now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr.\\r\\nBennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\r\\nraptures of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when the\\r\\ndoor was shut.  \"I do not know how you will ever make him\\r\\namends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.  At our\\r\\ntime of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\r\\nacquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\r\\nanything.  Lydia, my love, though you ARE the youngest, I dare\\r\\nsay Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I AM the\\r\\nyoungest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\r\\nwould return Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they\\r\\nshould ask him to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\r\\nfive daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\r\\nfrom her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\r\\nThey attacked him in various way-- with barefaced questions,\\r\\ningenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\r\\nskill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\\r\\nsecond-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.  Her\\r\\nreport was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted\\r\\nwith him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome,\\r\\nextremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be\\r\\nat the next assembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more\\r\\ndelightful!  To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards\\r\\nfalling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\\'s heart\\r\\nwere entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\r\\nNetherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the\\r\\nothers equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and sat\\r\\nabout ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained\\r\\nhopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of\\r\\nwhose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.\\r\\nThe ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the\\r\\nadvantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore\\r\\na blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\r\\nalready had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\r\\ncredit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which\\r\\ndeferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the\\r\\nfollowing day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour\\r\\nof their invitation, etc.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\\r\\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so\\r\\nsoon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear\\r\\nthat he might be always flying about from one place to another,\\r\\nand never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas\\r\\nquieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone\\r\\nto London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report\\r\\nsoon followed, that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\\r\\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls grieved\\r\\nover such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day\\r\\nbefore the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought\\r\\nonly six with him from London-- his five sisters and a cousin.\\r\\nAnd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of\\r\\nonly five altogether-- Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband\\r\\nof the eldest, and another young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a\\r\\npleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His\\r\\nsisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.  His\\r\\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but\\r\\nhis friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by\\r\\nhis fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the\\r\\nreport which was in general circulation within five minutes\\r\\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The\\r\\ngentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the\\r\\nladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and\\r\\nhe was looked at with great admiration for about half the\\r\\nevening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of\\r\\nhis popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above\\r\\nhis company, and above being pleased; and not all his large\\r\\nestate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\r\\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to\\r\\nbe compared with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\r\\nprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\r\\ndanced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,\\r\\nand talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable\\r\\nqualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between\\r\\nhim and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.\\r\\nHurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced\\r\\nto any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking\\r\\nabout the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\r\\nHis character was decided.  He was the proudest, most\\r\\ndisagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he\\r\\nwould never come there again.  Amongst the most violent\\r\\nagainst him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general\\r\\nbehaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\r\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of\\r\\ngentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that\\r\\ntime, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear\\r\\na conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from\\r\\nthe dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance.  I hate to see\\r\\nyou standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.  You had\\r\\nmuch better dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am\\r\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly as\\r\\nthis it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged, and\\r\\nthere is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\r\\npunishment to me to stand up with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley,\\r\\n\"for a kingdom!  Upon my honour, I never met with so many\\r\\npleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are\\r\\nseveral of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!  But\\r\\nthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is\\r\\nvery pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my\\r\\npartner to introduce you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a\\r\\nmoment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own\\r\\nand coldly said:  \"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to\\r\\ntempt ME; I am in no humour at present to give consequence\\r\\nto young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better\\r\\nreturn to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting\\r\\nyour time with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\r\\nElizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.\\r\\nShe told the story, however, with great spirit among her\\r\\nfriends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted\\r\\nin anything ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole\\r\\nfamily.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much\\r\\nadmired by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with\\r\\nher twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane\\r\\nwas as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in\\r\\na quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s pleasure.  Mary had heard\\r\\nherself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished\\r\\ngirl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\r\\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all\\r\\nthat they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned,\\r\\ntherefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they\\r\\nlived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They\\r\\nfound Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book he was regardless of\\r\\ntime; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of\\r\\ncuriosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such\\r\\nsplendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that his wife\\'s\\r\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon\\r\\nfound out that he had a different story to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have\\r\\nhad a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish you\\r\\nhad been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\r\\nEverybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought\\r\\nher quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!  Only think of\\r\\nTHAT, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was\\r\\nthe only creature in the room that he asked a second time.\\r\\nFirst of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to see him\\r\\nstand up with her!  But, however, he did not admire her at all;\\r\\nindeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with\\r\\nJane as she was going down the dance.  So he inquired who she\\r\\nwas, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.  Then\\r\\nthe two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with\\r\\n Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two\\r\\nsixth with Lizzy, and the BOULANGER--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he had had any compassion for ME,\" cried her husband\\r\\nimpatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much!  For God\\'s\\r\\nsake, say no more of his partners.  O that he had\\r\\nsprained his ankle in the first place!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him.  He is so\\r\\nexcessively handsome!  And his sisters are charming women.  I\\r\\nnever in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.  I\\r\\ndare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against\\r\\nany description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek\\r\\nanother branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness\\r\\nof spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose\\r\\nmuch by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,\\r\\nhorrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so conceited\\r\\nthat there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and he\\r\\nwalked there, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome\\r\\nenough to dance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to\\r\\nhave given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\r\\ncautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\r\\nsister just how very much she admired him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\r\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--\\r\\nso much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man\\r\\nought likewise to be, if he possibly can.  His character is thereby\\r\\ncomplete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\r\\ntime.  I did not expect such a compliment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not you? I did for you.  But that is one great difference\\r\\nbetween us.  Compliments always take YOU by surprise, and\\r\\nME never.  What could be more natural than his asking you\\r\\nagain?  He could not help seeing that you were about five times\\r\\nas pretty as every other woman in the room.  No thanks to his\\r\\ngallantry for that.  Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I\\r\\ngive you leave to like him.  You have liked many a stupider\\r\\nperson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\r\\ngeneral.  You never see a fault in anybody.  All the world are\\r\\ngood and agreeable in your eyes.  I never heard you speak ill of\\r\\na human being in your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\\r\\nspeak what I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you do; and it is THAT which makes the wonder.  With\\r\\nYOUR good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\r\\nnonsense of others!  Affectation of candour is common enough--\\r\\none meets with it everywhere.  But to be candid without\\r\\nostentation or design-- to take the good of everybody\\'s\\r\\ncharacter and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--\\r\\nbelongs to you alone.  And so you like this man\\'s sisters, too, do\\r\\nyou?  Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not-- at first.  But they are very pleasing women when\\r\\nyou converse with them.  Miss Bingley is to live with her\\r\\nbrother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall\\r\\nnot find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\r\\nbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\r\\ngeneral; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\r\\nof temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\\r\\nany attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\r\\nthem.  They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\r\\nhumour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\\r\\nthemselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\r\\nconceited.  They were rather handsome, had been educated in\\r\\none of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of\\r\\ntwenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more\\r\\nthan they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and\\r\\nwere therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\\r\\nthemselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable\\r\\nfamily in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\\r\\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune\\r\\nand their own had been acquired by trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a\\r\\nhundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to\\r\\npurchase an estate, but did not live to do it.  Mr. Bingley\\r\\nintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county;\\r\\nbut as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of\\r\\na manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the\\r\\neasiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\r\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next\\r\\ngeneration to purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\\r\\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\r\\nwas by no means unwilling to preside at his table-- nor was Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\r\\ndisposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\r\\nMr. Bingley had not been or age two years, when he was tempted\\r\\nby an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.\\r\\nHe did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour-- was pleased with\\r\\nthe situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the\\r\\nowner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\r\\nspite of great opposition of character.  Bingley was endeared to\\r\\nDarcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\r\\nthough no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\r\\nand though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.  On the\\r\\nstrength of Darcy\\'s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\r\\nof his judgement the highest opinion.  In understanding, Darcy\\r\\nwas the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy\\r\\nwas clever.  He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\r\\nfastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\r\\nIn that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.  Bingley was\\r\\nsure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\r\\ngiving offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\r\\nsufficiently characteristic.  Bingley had never met with more\\r\\npleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\r\\nmost kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\r\\nstiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\\r\\nto Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\r\\nDarcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\r\\nthere was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\r\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention\\r\\nor pleasure.  Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she\\r\\nsmiled too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so-- but still they\\r\\nadmired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet\\r\\ngirl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\\r\\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their\\r\\nbrother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as\\r\\nhe chose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom\\r\\nthe Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas had\\r\\nbeen formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a\\r\\ntolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an\\r\\naddress to the king during his mayoralty.  The distinction had\\r\\nperhaps been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust to\\r\\nhis business, and to his residence in a small market town; and,\\r\\nin quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a\\r\\nhouse about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that\\r\\nperiod Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his\\r\\nown importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself\\r\\nsolely in being civil to all the world.  For, though elated by his\\r\\nrank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was\\r\\nall attention to everybody.  By nature inoffensive, friendly, and\\r\\nobliging, his presentation at St. James\\'s had made him\\r\\ncourteous.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to\\r\\nbe a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.  They had several\\r\\nchildren.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young\\r\\nwoman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to\\r\\ntalk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after\\r\\nthe assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\r\\ncommunicate. \"YOU began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.  \"YOU\\r\\nwere Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her\\r\\ntwice. To be sure that DID seem as if he admired her-- indeed I\\r\\nrather believe he DID-- I heard something about it-- but I\\r\\nhardly know what-- something about Mr. Robinson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.\\r\\nRobinson; did not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson\\'s asking\\r\\nhim how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did\\r\\nnot think there were a great many pretty women in the room,\\r\\nand WHICH he thought the prettiest? and his answering\\r\\nimmediately to the last question:  \\'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\\r\\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word!  Well, that is very decided indeed-- that does\\r\\nseem as if-- but, however, it may all come to nothing, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS,\\r\\nEliza,\" said Charlotte.  \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth\\r\\nlistening to as his friend, is he?-- poor Eliza!-- to be only just\\r\\nTOLERABLE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by\\r\\nhis ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it\\r\\nwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long\\r\\ntold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour\\r\\nwithout once opening his lips.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you quite sure, ma\\'am?-- is not there a little mistake?\"\\r\\nsaid Jane.  \"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield,\\r\\nand he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed\\r\\nquite angry at being spoke to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much,\\r\\nunless among his intimate acquaintances.  With THEM he is\\r\\nremarkably agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so very\\r\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can guess\\r\\nhow it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I\\r\\ndare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep\\r\\na carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas,\\r\\n\"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance\\r\\nwith HIM, if I were you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, ma\\'am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance\\r\\nwith him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend ME so much as\\r\\npride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One cannot\\r\\nwonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\r\\neverything in his favour, should think highly of himself.  If I\\r\\nmay so express it, he has a RIGHT to be proud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily\\r\\nforgive HIS pride, if he had not mortified MINE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity\\r\\nof her reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\r\\nthat I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\r\\nindeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\r\\nthere are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\r\\nself-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\r\\nimaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\r\\nwords are often used synonymously.  A person may be proud\\r\\nwithout being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of\\r\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who\\r\\ncame with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was.  I\\r\\nwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a\\r\\nday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\r\\nyour bottle directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\r\\nthat she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.\\r\\nThe visit was soon returned in due form.  Miss Bennet\\'s\\r\\npleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\r\\nBingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable,\\r\\nand the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of\\r\\nbeing better acquainted with THEM was expressed towards\\r\\nthe two eldest.  By Jane, this attention was received with the\\r\\ngreatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in\\r\\ntheir treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister,\\r\\nand could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it\\r\\nwas, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence\\r\\nof their brother\\'s admiration.  It was generally evident\\r\\nwhenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was\\r\\nequally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which\\r\\nshe had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\r\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure\\r\\nthat it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general,\\r\\nsince Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure\\r\\nof temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would\\r\\nguard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.  She\\r\\nmentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to\\r\\nimpose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\r\\ndisadvantage to be so very guarded.  If a woman conceals her\\r\\naffection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\r\\nthe opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\r\\nconsolation to believe the world equally in the dark.  There is\\r\\nso much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that\\r\\nit is not safe to leave any to itself.  We can all BEGIN freely-- a\\r\\nslight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\r\\nwho have heart enough to be really in love without\\r\\nencouragement.  In nine cases out of ten a women had better\\r\\nshow MORE affection than she feels.  Bingley, likes your\\r\\nsister, undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if\\r\\nshe does not help him on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.  If\\r\\nI can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,\\r\\nindeed, not to discover it too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as\\r\\nyou do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\r\\nconceal it, he must find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.  But, though\\r\\nBingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many\\r\\nhours together; and, as they always see each other in large\\r\\nmixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be\\r\\nemployed in conversing together.  Jane should therefore make\\r\\nthe most of every half-hour in which she can command his\\r\\nattention.  When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure\\r\\nfor falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is\\r\\nin question but the desire of being well married, and if I were\\r\\ndetermined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\r\\nshould adopt it.  But these are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not\\r\\nacting by design.  As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\r\\ndegree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.  She has\\r\\nknown him only a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him\\r\\nat Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and\\r\\nhas since dined with him in company four times. This is not\\r\\nquite enough to make her understand his character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, she\\r\\nmight only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\r\\nyou must remember that four evenings have also been spent\\r\\ntogether-- and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\r\\nthey both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect\\r\\nto any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much\\r\\nhas been unfolded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\r\\nand if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she\\r\\nhad as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying\\r\\nhis character for a twelvemonth.  Happiness in marriage is\\r\\nentirely  a matter of chance.  If the dispositions of the parties are\\r\\never so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand,\\r\\nit does not advance their felicity in the least.  They always\\r\\ncontinue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their\\r\\nshare of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of\\r\\nthe defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.  You know\\r\\nit is not sound, and that you would never act in this way\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\'s attentions to her sister,\\r\\nElizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\r\\nan object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\r\\nher without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\r\\nlooked at her only to criticise.  But no sooner had he made it\\r\\nclear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature\\r\\nin her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly\\r\\nintelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.  To this\\r\\ndiscovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.  Though he\\r\\nhad detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect\\r\\nsymmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure\\r\\nto be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her\\r\\nmanners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught\\r\\nby their easy playfulness.  Of this she was perfectly unaware; to\\r\\nher he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere,\\r\\nand who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\r\\nconversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\r\\nothers.  His doing so drew her notice.  It was at Sir William\\r\\nLucas\\'s, where a large party were assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by\\r\\nlistening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\r\\nsee what he is about.  He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not\\r\\nbegin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without\\r\\nseeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied\\r\\nher friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately\\r\\nprovoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself\\r\\nuncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster\\r\\nto give us a ball at Meryton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\r\\nenergetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be HER turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas.  \"I\\r\\nam going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what\\r\\nfollows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!-- always\\r\\nwanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!  If\\r\\nmy vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been\\r\\ninvaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before\\r\\nthose who must be in the habit of hearing the very best\\r\\nperformers.\"  On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however, she added,\\r\\n\"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\"  And gravely glancing at Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\\r\\ncourse familiar with:  \\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge\\';\\r\\nand I shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.\\r\\nAfter a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties\\r\\nof several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded\\r\\nat the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence\\r\\nof being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for\\r\\nknowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for\\r\\ndisplay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\r\\nher application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\r\\nconceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\r\\nexcellence than she had reached.  Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\r\\nhad been listened to with much more pleasure, though not\\r\\nplaying half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto,\\r\\nwas glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish\\r\\nairs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the\\r\\nLucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at\\r\\none end of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode\\r\\nof passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\r\\nwas too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir\\r\\nWilliam Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as\\r\\none of the first refinements of polished society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\r\\namongst the less polished societies of the world.  Every savage\\r\\ncan dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William only smiled.  \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\\r\\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I\\r\\ndoubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\r\\nsight.  Do you often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the\\r\\nplace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself-- for I am\\r\\nfond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the\\r\\nair of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\r\\ndisposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\r\\ntowards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very\\r\\ngallant thing, and called out to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?  Mr. Darcy, you\\r\\nmust allow me to present this young lady to you as a very\\r\\ndesirable partner.  You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when\\r\\nso much beauty is before you.\"  And, taking her hand, he would\\r\\nhave given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised,\\r\\nwas not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back,\\r\\nand said with some discomposure to Sir William:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.  I entreat\\r\\nyou not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a\\r\\npartner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\\r\\nhonour of her hand, but in vain.  Elizabeth was determined; nor\\r\\ndid Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\\r\\npersuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\\r\\ndeny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\\r\\ndislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I\\r\\nam sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\\r\\nEliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance-- for who would\\r\\nobject to such a partner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away.  Her resistance had\\r\\nnot injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her\\r\\nwith some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass\\r\\nmany evenings in this manner-- in such society; and indeed I am\\r\\nquite of you opinion.  I was never more annoyed!  The insipidity,\\r\\nand yet the noise-- the nothingness, and yet the self-importance\\r\\nof all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on\\r\\nthem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.  My mind was\\r\\nmore agreeably engaged.  I have been meditating on the very\\r\\ngreat pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty\\r\\nwoman can bestow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, a desired he\\r\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\\r\\nreflections.  Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley.  \"I am all\\r\\nastonishment.  How long has she been such a favourite?-- and\\r\\npray, when am I to wish you joy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.  A\\r\\nlady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\\r\\nlove, from love to matrimony, in a moment.  I knew you would\\r\\nbe wishing me joy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\\r\\nabsolutely settled.  You will be having a charming\\r\\nmother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at\\r\\nPemberley with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to\\r\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\\r\\nher that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\\r\\ntwo thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\\r\\nentailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their\\r\\nmother\\'s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could\\r\\nbut ill supply the deficiency of his.  Her father had been an\\r\\nattorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\\r\\nto their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\\r\\nsettled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a\\r\\nmost convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\\r\\ntempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\\r\\ntheir aunt and to a milliner\\'s shop just over the way.  The two\\r\\nyoungest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\\r\\nfrequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\\r\\ntheir sisters\\', and when nothing better offered, a walk to\\r\\nMeryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and\\r\\nfurnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\\r\\nthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\\r\\nsome from their aunt.  At present, indeed, they were well\\r\\nsupplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of\\r\\na militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the\\r\\nwhole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most\\r\\ninteresting intelligence.  Every day added something to their\\r\\nknowledge of the officers\\' names and connections.  Their\\r\\nlodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to\\r\\nknow the officers themselves.  Mr. Phillips visited them all, and\\r\\nthis opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.\\r\\nThey could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\\'s large\\r\\nfortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother,\\r\\nwas worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\\r\\nan ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\r\\nBennet coolly observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\\r\\nbe two of the silliest girls in the country.  I have suspected it\\r\\nsome time, but I am now convinced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia,\\r\\nwith perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\\r\\nCaptain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\\r\\nday, as he was going the next morning to London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should\\r\\nbe so ready to think your own children silly.  If I wished to think\\r\\nslightingly of anybody\\'s children, it should not be of my own,\\r\\nhowever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\\r\\nagree.  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\\r\\nparticular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\\r\\nyoungest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have\\r\\nthe sense of their father and mother.  When they get to our age, I\\r\\ndare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\r\\nI remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--\\r\\nand, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young\\r\\ncolonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my\\r\\ngirls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster\\r\\nlooked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in his\\r\\nregimentals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\\r\\nCaptain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did\\r\\nwhen they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\\r\\nClarke\\'s library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the\\r\\nfootman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield,\\r\\nand the servant waited for an answer.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes\\r\\nsparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while\\r\\nher daughter read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from?  What is it about?  What does he\\r\\nsay?  Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--\\r\\n     \"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with\\r\\nLouisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for\\r\\nthe rest of our lives, for a whole day\\'s tete-a-tete between two\\r\\nwomen can never end without a quarrel.  Come as soon as you\\r\\ncan on receipt of this.  My brother and the gentlemen are to dine\\r\\nwith the officers.-- Yours ever,\\r\\n                                             \"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia.  \"I wonder my aunt did not tell\\r\\nus of THAT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\\r\\nlikely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were\\r\\nsure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\'s chaise to go to\\r\\nMeryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\r\\nThey are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s\\r\\npurpose will be answered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that\\r\\nthe horses were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on\\r\\nhorseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\\r\\ncheerful prognostics of a bad day.  Her hopes were answered;\\r\\nJane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters\\r\\nwere uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain\\r\\ncontinued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly\\r\\ncould not some back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet more\\r\\nthan once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.  Till\\r\\nthe next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity\\r\\nof her contrivance.  Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant\\r\\nfrom Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--\\r\\n     \"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I\\r\\nsuppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.\\r\\nMy kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\\r\\nThey insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones-- therefore do not be\\r\\nalarmed if you should hear of his having been to me-- and,\\r\\nexcepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\\r\\nmatter with me.-- Yours, etc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\\r\\nnote aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\\r\\nillness-- if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\\r\\nwas all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying.  People do not die of little\\r\\ntrifling colds.  She will be taken good care of.  As long as she\\r\\nstays there, it is all very well.  I would go an see her if I could\\r\\nhave the carriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\r\\nthough the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\r\\nhorsewoman, walking was her only alternative.  She declared her\\r\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such\\r\\na thing, in all this dirt!  You will not be fit to be seen when you\\r\\nget there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane-- which is all I want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the horses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\r\\nnothing when one has a motive; only three miles.  I shall be back\\r\\nby dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but\\r\\nevery impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\r\\nopinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\r\\nrequired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and\\r\\nLydia.  Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\r\\nladies set off together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps\\r\\nwe may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the\\r\\nlodgings of one of the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued\\r\\nher walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping\\r\\nover stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity,\\r\\nand finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\r\\nankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\r\\nexercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane\\r\\nwere assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal\\r\\nof surprise.  That she should have walked three miles so early in\\r\\nthe day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost\\r\\nincredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nconvinced that they held her in contempt for it.  She was\\r\\nreceived, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\\'s\\r\\nmanners there was something better than politeness; there was\\r\\ngood humour and kindness.  Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\\r\\nHurst nothing at all.  The former was divided between\\r\\nadmiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her\\r\\ncomplexion, and doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming\\r\\nso far alone.  The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\r\\nMiss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\r\\nnot well enough to leave her room.  Elizabeth was glad to be\\r\\ntaken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld\\r\\nby the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in\\r\\nher note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at\\r\\nher entrance.  She was not equal, however, to much\\r\\nconversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could\\r\\nattempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\\r\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with.  Elizabeth silently\\r\\nattended her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and\\r\\nElizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\r\\naffection and solicitude they showed for Jane.  The apothecary\\r\\ncame, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\r\\nsupposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\r\\nendeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\r\\nand promised her some draughts.  The advice was followed\\r\\nreadily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached\\r\\nacutely.  Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\\r\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had,\\r\\nin fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\r\\nvery unwillingly said so.  Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\r\\nand she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\r\\ntestified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\r\\nobliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\r\\nremain at Netherfield for the present.  Elizabeth most thankfully\\r\\nconsented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to\\r\\nacquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of\\r\\nclothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\r\\nsix Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.  To the civil inquiries\\r\\nwhich then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure\\r\\nof distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nshe could not make a very favourable answer.  Jane was by no\\r\\nmeans better.  The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\r\\ntimes how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have\\r\\na bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill\\r\\nthemselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\r\\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them\\r\\nrestored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\r\\ncould regard with any complacency.  His anxiety for Jane was\\r\\nevident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\r\\nprevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she\\r\\nbelieved she was considered by the others. She had very little\\r\\nnotice from any but him.  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom\\r\\nElizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat,\\r\\ndrink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a\\r\\nplain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\r\\nBingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.\\r\\nHer manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture\\r\\nof pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no\\r\\nbeauty.  Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\r\\nexcellent walker.  I shall never forget her appearance this\\r\\nmorning.  She really looked almost wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my countenance.\\r\\nVery nonsensical to come at all!  Why must SHE be scampering\\r\\nabout the country, because her sister had a cold?  Her hair, so\\r\\nuntidy, so blowsy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\r\\ndeep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had\\r\\nbeen let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but\\r\\nthis was all lost upon me.  I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\r\\nlooked remarkably well when she came into the room this\\r\\nmorning.  Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n\"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see\\r\\nYOUR sister make such an exhibition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it\\r\\nis, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!  What could\\r\\nshe mean by it?  It seems to me to show an abominable sort of\\r\\nconceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\r\\ndecorum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\r\\nBingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half\\r\\nwhisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your\\r\\nadmiration of her fine eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"\\r\\nA short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\r\\nvery sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\r\\nsettled.  But with such a father and mother, and such low\\r\\nconnections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on\\r\\nMeryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near\\r\\nCheapside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed\\r\\nheartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,\" cried\\r\\nBingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\r\\nof any consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\r\\ntheir hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the\\r\\nexpense of their dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her\\r\\nroom on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till\\r\\nsummoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth\\r\\nwould not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had\\r\\nthe comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather\\r\\nright than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.  On\\r\\nentering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and\\r\\nwas immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\r\\nplaying high, she declined it, for the short time she could stay\\r\\nbelow, with a book.  Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather\\r\\nsingular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a\\r\\ngreat reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\"said\\r\\nBingley; \"and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite\\r\\nwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards\\r\\nthe table where a few books were lying.  He immediately offered\\r\\nto fetch her others-- all that his library afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my\\r\\nown credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many,\\r\\nI have more than I ever looked into.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\r\\nthose in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should\\r\\nhave left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\r\\nyou have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\r\\ngenerations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are\\r\\nalways buying books.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\r\\nas these.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neglect!  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\r\\nbeauties of that noble place.  Charles, when you build YOUR\\r\\nhouse, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\r\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.  There\\r\\nis not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\r\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her\\r\\nvery little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside,\\r\\nshe drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.\\r\\nBingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think she will.  She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s\\r\\nheight, or rather taller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\r\\ndelighted me so much.  Such a countenance, such manners!  And\\r\\nso extremely accomplished for her age!  Her performance on the\\r\\npianoforte is exquisite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have\\r\\npatience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\r\\nmean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think.  They all paint tables, cover screens,\\r\\nand net purses.  I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this,\\r\\nand I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\r\\ntime, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a\\r\\nwoman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or\\r\\ncovering a screen.  But I am very far from agreeing with you in\\r\\nyour estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing\\r\\nmore than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance,\\r\\nthat are really accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal\\r\\nin your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\r\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\r\\nusually met with.  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\r\\nmusic, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\r\\ndeserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain\\r\\nsomething in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her\\r\\nvoice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\r\\nhalf-deserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she\\r\\nmust yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\r\\nher mind by extensive reading.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six\\r\\naccomplished women.  I rather wonder now at your knowing\\r\\nANY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the\\r\\npossibility of all this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw such a woman.  I never saw such capacity, and\\r\\ntaste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\r\\nof her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\r\\nmany women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst\\r\\ncalled them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention\\r\\nto what was going forward.  As all conversation was thereby at\\r\\nan end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was\\r\\nclosed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to\\r\\nrecommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their\\r\\nown; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.  But, in my\\r\\nopinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\r\\naddressed, \"there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies\\r\\nsometimes condescend to employ for captivation.  Whatever\\r\\nbears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\r\\ncontinue the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\r\\nworse, and that she could not leave her.  Bingley urged Mr.\\r\\nJones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced\\r\\nthat no country advice could be of any service, recommended an\\r\\nexpress to town for one of the most eminent physicians.  This\\r\\nshe would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply\\r\\nwith their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones\\r\\nshould be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not\\r\\ndecidedly better.  Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\r\\ndeclared that they were miserable:  They solaced their\\r\\nwretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could\\r\\nfind no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper\\r\\ndirections that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and\\r\\nher sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and\\r\\nin the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\r\\nanswer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\r\\nBingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\r\\nelegant ladies who waited on his sisters.  In spite of this\\r\\namendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\r\\nLongbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\r\\njudgement of her situation.  The note was immediately\\r\\ndispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached\\r\\nNetherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would\\r\\nhave been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that\\r\\nher illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\r\\nimmediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\r\\nher from Netherfield.  She would not listen, therefore, to her\\r\\ndaughter\\'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\r\\napothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\r\\nadvisable.  After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\r\\nBingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\r\\ndaughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.  Bingley met\\r\\nthem with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\r\\nworse than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill\\r\\nto be moved.  Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\r\\nWe must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley.  \"It must not be thought of.  My\\r\\nsister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon it, madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold\\r\\ncivility, \"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention\\r\\nwhile she remains with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do\\r\\nnot know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\r\\nand suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\r\\nworld, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\r\\nexception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.  I often tell\\r\\nmy other girls they are nothing to HER. You have a sweet room\\r\\nhere, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel\\r\\nwalk.  I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\r\\nNetherfield.  You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope,\\r\\nthough you have but a short lease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\r\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\r\\nfive minutes.  At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\r\\nfixed here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning\\r\\ntowards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- I understand you perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily\\r\\nseen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is as it happens.  It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\r\\ncharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not\\r\\nrun on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that\\r\\nyour were a studier of character.  It must be an amusing study.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing.  They\\r\\nhave at least that advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few\\r\\nsubjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood you move\\r\\nin a very confined and unvarying society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something\\r\\nnew to be observed in them for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of\\r\\nmentioning a country neighbourhood.  \"I assure you there is\\r\\nquite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\r\\nmoment, turned silently away.  Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she\\r\\nhad gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\\r\\ncountry, for my part, except the shops and public places.  The\\r\\ncountry is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\\r\\nand when I am in town it is pretty much the same.  They have\\r\\neach their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- that is because you have the right disposition.  But that\\r\\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was\\r\\nnothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for\\r\\nher mother.  \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.  He only meant that\\r\\nthere was not such a variety of people to be met with in the\\r\\ncountry as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be\\r\\ntrue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\\r\\nmeeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there\\r\\nare few neighbourhoods larger.  I know we dine with\\r\\nfour-and-twenty families.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\r\\nhis countenance.  His sister was less delicate, and directed her\\r\\neyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nfor the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\'s\\r\\nthoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at\\r\\nLongbourn since HER coming away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an agreeable\\r\\nman Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?  So much the man of\\r\\nfashion!  So genteel and easy!  He had always something to say\\r\\nto everybody.  THAT is my idea of good breeding; and those\\r\\npersons who fancy themselves very important, and never open\\r\\ntheir mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted about\\r\\nmince-pies.  For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants\\r\\nthat can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up very\\r\\ndifferently.  But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\r\\nLucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.  It is a pity\\r\\nthey are not handsome!  Not that I think Charlotte so VERY\\r\\nplain-- but then she is our particular friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nherself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty.  I do not\\r\\nlike to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane-- one does\\r\\nnot often see anybody better looking.  It is what everybody says.\\r\\nI do not trust my own partiality.  When she was only fifteen,\\r\\nthere was a man at my brother Gardiner\\'s in town so much in\\r\\nlove with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her\\r\\nan offer before we came away.  But, however, he did not.\\r\\nPerhaps he thought her too young.  However, he wrote some\\r\\nverses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently.  \"There\\r\\nhas been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.  I\\r\\nwonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving\\r\\naway love!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love,\" said\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of  a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Everything nourishes\\r\\nwhat is strong already.  But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\r\\ninclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\r\\nentirely away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\r\\nElizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\r\\nagain.  She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\r\\nand after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\r\\ntroubling him also with Lizzy.  Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly\\r\\ncivil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\r\\nand say what the occasion required.  She performed her part\\r\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was\\r\\nsatisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.  Upon this\\r\\nsignal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.  The\\r\\ntwo girls had been whispering to each other during the whole\\r\\nvisit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.\\r\\nBingley with having promised on his first coming into the\\r\\ncountry to give a ball at Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\r\\ncomplexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with\\r\\nher mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an\\r\\nearly age.  She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\r\\nself-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom\\r\\nher uncle\\'s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended\\r\\nher, had increased into assurance.  She was very equal,\\r\\ntherefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\r\\nabruptly reminded him that it would be the most shameful thing\\r\\nin the world if he did not keep it.  His answer to this sudden\\r\\nattack was delightful to her mother\\'s ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\r\\nwhen your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\r\\nvery day of the ball.  But you would not wish to be dancing\\r\\nwhen she is ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia declared herself satisfied.  \"Oh! yes-- it would be much\\r\\nbetter to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\r\\nCaptain Carter would be at Meryton again.  And when you have\\r\\ngiven YOUR ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their giving one\\r\\nalso.  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he\\r\\ndoes not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughter then departed, and Elizabeth\\r\\nreturned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\'\\r\\nbehaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the\\r\\nlatter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in\\r\\ntheir censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on\\r\\nFINE EYES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done.  Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\\r\\ninvalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\\r\\nevening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.  The\\r\\nloo-table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and\\r\\nMiss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\\r\\nletter and repeatedly calling his attention by messages to his\\r\\nsister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst was observing their game.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently\\r\\namused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his\\r\\ncompanion.  The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on\\r\\nhis handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length\\r\\nof his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises\\r\\nwere received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in\\r\\nunion with her opinion of each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the\\r\\ncourse of a year!  Letters of business, too!  How odious I should\\r\\nthink them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend it for you.  I\\r\\nmend pens remarkably well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you-- but I always mend my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\\r\\nthe harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\\r\\nher beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely\\r\\nsuperior to Miss Grantley\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?\\r\\nAt present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  It is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January.  But do\\r\\nyou always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not\\r\\nfor me to determine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\\r\\nwith ease, cannot write ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried\\r\\nher brother, \"because he does not write with ease.  He studies\\r\\ntoo much for words of four syllables.  Do not you, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless\\r\\nway imaginable.  He leaves out half his words, and blots the\\r\\nrest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--\\r\\nby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to\\r\\nmy correspondents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm\\r\\nreproof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\r\\nhumility.  It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\\r\\nan indirect boast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of\\r\\nmodesty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\r\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a\\r\\nrapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\\r\\nestimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of\\r\\ndoing anything with quickness is always prized much by the\\r\\npossessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\r\\nthe performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that\\r\\nif you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be\\r\\ngone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\\r\\ncompliment to yourself-- and yet what is there so very laudable\\r\\nin a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\r\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone\\r\\nelse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all\\r\\nthe foolish things that were said in the morning.  And, yet, upon\\r\\nmy honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I\\r\\nbelieve it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume\\r\\nthe character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\\r\\nthe ladies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\r\\nyou would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would be\\r\\nquite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if,\\r\\nas you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,  \\'Bingley,\\r\\nyou had better stay till next week,\\' you would probably do it,\\r\\nyou would probably not go-- and at another word, might stay a\\r\\nmonth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr.\\r\\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition.  You have\\r\\nshown him off now much more than he did himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting\\r\\nwhat my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\\r\\ntemper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\\r\\ngentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\\r\\nbetter of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\\r\\ndenial, and ride off as fast as I could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\\r\\nintentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must\\r\\nspeak for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to\\r\\ncall mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the\\r\\ncase, however, to stand according to your representation, you\\r\\nmust remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to\\r\\ndesire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has\\r\\nmerely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in\\r\\nfavour of its propriety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield readily-- easily-- to the PERSUASION of a friend is\\r\\nno merit with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\\r\\nunderstanding of either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the\\r\\ninfluence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the requester\\r\\nwould often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting\\r\\nfor arguments to reason one into it.  I am not particularly\\r\\nspeaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance\\r\\noccurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\r\\nthereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between friend and\\r\\nfriend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a\\r\\nresolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that\\r\\nperson for complying with the desire, without waiting to be\\r\\nargued into it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\r\\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance\\r\\nwhich is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\\r\\nintimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\r\\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have\\r\\nmore weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\\r\\naware of.  I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall\\r\\nfellow, in comparison with myself, that I should not pay him half\\r\\nso much deference.  I declare I do not know a more awful object\\r\\nthan Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at\\r\\nhis own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\\r\\nnothing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\\r\\nhe was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.  Miss\\r\\nBingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\\r\\nexpostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.  \"You dislike an\\r\\nargument, and want to silence this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I do.  Arguments are too much like disputes.  If you\\r\\nand Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\\r\\nbe very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\\r\\nElizabeth for an indulgence of some music.  Miss Bingley moved\\r\\nwith some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request\\r\\nthat Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely\\r\\nand more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\\r\\nemployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned\\r\\nover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how\\r\\nfrequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly knew\\r\\nhow to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so\\r\\ngreat a man; and yet that he should look at her because he\\r\\ndisliked her, was still more strange.  She could only imagine,\\r\\nhowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was\\r\\nsomething more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas\\r\\nof right, than in any other person present.  The supposition did\\r\\nnot pain her.  She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\\r\\nby a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\\r\\nnear Elizabeth, said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\\r\\nan opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with\\r\\nsome surprise at her silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\r\\ndetermine what to say in reply.  You wanted me, I know, to say\\r\\n\\'Yes,\\' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\\r\\nbut I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and\\r\\ncheating a person of their meditated contempt.  I have,\\r\\ntherefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\\r\\ndance a reel at all-- and now despise me if you dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\\r\\nhis gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\\r\\nin her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\\r\\nand Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he\\r\\nwas by her.  He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority\\r\\nof her connections, he should be in some danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\\r\\ngreat anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\\r\\nsome assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\\r\\ntalking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\\r\\nsuch an alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the\\r\\nshrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few\\r\\nhints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\\r\\nof holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the\\r\\nyounger girls of running after officers.  And, if I may mention so\\r\\ndelicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\\r\\nbordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\\r\\npossesses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes.  Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips get\\r\\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next to your\\r\\ngreat-uncle the judge.  They are in the same profession, you\\r\\nknow, only in different lines.  As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you\\r\\nmust not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those\\r\\nbeautiful eyes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\r\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might\\r\\nbe copied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Elizabeth herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley,\\r\\nin some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You used us abominably ill, \"answered Mrs. Hurst, \"running\\r\\naway without telling us that you were coming out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\\r\\nto walk by herself.  The path just admitted three.  Mr. Darcy felt\\r\\ntheir rudeness, and immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go\\r\\ninto the avenue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\\r\\nthem, laughingly answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; stay where you are.  You are charmingly grouped, and\\r\\nappear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be\\r\\nspoilt by admitting a fourth.  Good-bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the\\r\\nhope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already\\r\\nso much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\\r\\nhours that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\r\\nsister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into\\r\\nthe drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends\\r\\nwith many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen\\r\\nthem so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed\\r\\nbefore the gentlemen appeared.  Their powers of conversation\\r\\nwere considerable.  They could describe an entertainment with\\r\\naccuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\r\\nacquaintance with spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first\\r\\nobject; Miss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,\\r\\nand she had something to say to him before he had advanced\\r\\nmany steps.  He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite\\r\\ncongratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said\\r\\nhe was \"very glad\"; but diffuseness and warmth remained for\\r\\nBingley\\'s salutation.  He was full of joy and attention.  The first\\r\\nhalf-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\r\\nfrom the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the\\r\\nother side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the\\r\\ndoor.  He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\r\\nelse.  Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with\\r\\ngreat delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\r\\ncard-table-- but in vain.  She had obtained private intelligence\\r\\nthat Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found\\r\\neven his open petition rejected.  She assured him that no one\\r\\nintended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the\\r\\nsubject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to\\r\\ndo, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\r\\nDarcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\r\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with\\r\\nMiss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s progress through HIS book, as in reading her own;\\r\\nand she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking\\r\\nat his page.  She could not win him, however, to any\\r\\nconversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.  At\\r\\nlength, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her\\r\\nown book, which she had only chosen because it was the second\\r\\nvolume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\\r\\nis to spend an evening in this way!  I declare after all there is no\\r\\nenjoyment like reading!  How much sooner one tires of anything\\r\\nthan of a book!  When I have a house of my own, I shall be\\r\\nmiserable if I have not an excellent library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one made any reply.  She then yawned again, threw aside her\\r\\nbook, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\r\\namusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\r\\nBennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance\\r\\nat Netherfield?  I would advise you, before you determine on it,\\r\\nto consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if\\r\\nthere are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a\\r\\npunishment than a pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\\r\\nchooses, before it begins-- but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\r\\nthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I\\r\\nshall send round my cards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\r\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something\\r\\ninsufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.  It\\r\\nwould surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\r\\ndancing were made the order of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\r\\nnot be near so much like a ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up\\r\\nand walked about the room.  Her figure was elegant, and she\\r\\nwalked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still\\r\\ninflexibly studious.  In the desperation of her feelings, she\\r\\nresolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,\\r\\nand take a turn about the room.  I assure you it is very refreshing\\r\\nafter sitting so long in one attitude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.  Miss\\r\\nBingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\r\\nDarcy looked up.  He was as much awake to the novelty of\\r\\nattention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and\\r\\nunconsciously closed his book.  He was directly invited to join\\r\\ntheir party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine\\r\\nbut two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the\\r\\nroom together, with either of which motives his joining them\\r\\nwould interfere.  \"What could he mean?  She was dying to know\\r\\nwhat could be his meaning?\"-- and asked Elizabeth whether she\\r\\ncould at all understand him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to\\r\\nbe severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be\\r\\nto ask nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.\\r\\nDarcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an\\r\\nexplanation of his two motives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he,\\r\\nas soon as she allowed him to speak.  \"You either choose this\\r\\nmethod of passing the evening because you are in each other\\'s\\r\\nconfidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are\\r\\nconscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in\\r\\nwalking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if\\r\\nthe second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley.  \"I never heard anything so\\r\\nabominable.  How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\"We can all plague and punish one another.  Tease him-- laugh\\r\\nat him.  Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be\\r\\ndone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But upon my honour, I do NOT.  I do assure you that my\\r\\nintimacy has not yet taught me THAT.  Tease calmness of\\r\\nmanner and presence of mind!  No, no-- feel he may defy us\\r\\nthere.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you\\r\\nplease, by attempting to laugh without a subject.  Mr. Darcy may\\r\\nhug himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"That is an\\r\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue,\\r\\nfor it would be a great loss to ME to have many such\\r\\nacquaintances.  I dearly love a laugh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\r\\nThe wisest and the best of men-- nay, the wisest and best of their\\r\\nactions-- may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first\\r\\nobject in life is a joke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth-- \"there are such people, but I\\r\\nhope I am not one of THEM.  I hope I never ridicule what is\\r\\nwise and good.  Follies and nonsense, whims and\\r\\ninconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them\\r\\nwhenever I can.  But these, I suppose, are precisely what you\\r\\nare without.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.  But it has been the\\r\\nstudy of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a\\r\\nstrong understanding to ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.  But pride-- where there is a\\r\\nreal superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\\r\\nregulation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"and pray what is the result?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.\\r\\nHe owns it himself without disguise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension.  I have\\r\\nfaults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.  My\\r\\ntemper I dare not vouch for.  It is, I believe, too little yielding--\\r\\ncertainly too little for the convenience of the world.  I cannot\\r\\nforget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their\\r\\noffenses against myself.  My feelings are not puffed about with\\r\\nevery attempt to move them.  My temper would perhaps be\\r\\ncalled resentful.  My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable\\r\\nresentment IS a shade in a character.  But you have chosen your\\r\\nfault well.  I really cannot LAUGH at it.  You are safe from me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some\\r\\nparticular evil-- a natural defect, which not even the best\\r\\neducation can overcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yours, \"he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to\\r\\nmisunderstand them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\r\\nconversation in which she had no share.  \"Louisa, you will not\\r\\nmind my waking Mr. Hurst?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\r\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments\\' recollection, was not\\r\\nsorry for it.  He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too\\r\\nmuch attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\\r\\nwrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage\\r\\nmight be sent for them in the course of the day.  But Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at\\r\\nNetherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly\\r\\nfinish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with\\r\\npleasure before.  Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\r\\nleast not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get\\r\\nhome.  Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly\\r\\nhave the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was\\r\\nadded, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay\\r\\nlonger, she could spare them very well.  Against staying longer,\\r\\nhowever, Elizabeth was positively resolved-- nor did she much\\r\\nexpect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being\\r\\nconsidered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged\\r\\nJane to borrow Mr. Bingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at\\r\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving\\r\\nNetherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and\\r\\nenough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the\\r\\nfollowing day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going\\r\\nwas deferred.  Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had\\r\\nproposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister\\r\\nmuch exceeded her affection for the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were\\r\\nto go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that\\r\\nit would not be safe for her-- that she was not enough recovered;\\r\\nbut Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence-- Elizabeth had been\\r\\nat Netherfield long enough.  She attracted him more than he\\r\\nliked-- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more teasing\\r\\nthan usual to himself.  He wisely resolved to be particularly\\r\\ncareful that no sign of admiration should NOW escape him,\\r\\nnothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his\\r\\nfelicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his\\r\\nbehaviour during the last day must have material weight in\\r\\nconfirming or crushing it.  Steady to his purpose, he scarcely\\r\\nspoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and\\r\\nthough they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour,\\r\\nhe adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not\\r\\neven look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable\\r\\nto almost all, took place.  Miss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth\\r\\nincreased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane;\\r\\nand when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it\\r\\nwould always give her to see her either at Longbourn or\\r\\nNetherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook\\r\\nhands with the former.  Elizabeth took leave of the whole party\\r\\nin the liveliest of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very\\r\\nwrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have\\r\\ncaught cold again.  But their father, though very laconic in his\\r\\nexpressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt\\r\\ntheir importance in the family circle.  The evening conversation,\\r\\nwhen they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation,\\r\\nand almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass\\r\\nand human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some\\r\\nnew observations of threadbare morality to listen to.  Catherine\\r\\nand Lydia had information for them of a different sort.  Much\\r\\nhad been done and much had been said in the regiment since the\\r\\npreceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately\\r\\nwith their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually\\r\\nbeen hinted that colonel Foster was going to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\r\\nbreakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good\\r\\ndinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our\\r\\nfamily party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear?  I know of nobody that is coming,\\r\\nI am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in-- And\\r\\nI hope MY dinners are good enough for her.  I do not believe\\r\\nshe often sees such at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled.  \"A gentleman and a stranger!  It is\\r\\nMr. Bingley, I am sure!  Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\\r\\nto see Mr. Bingley.  But--good Lord! how unlucky!  There is not\\r\\na bit of fish to be got to-day.  Lydia, my love, ring the bell-- I\\r\\nmust speak to Hill this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is NOT Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom\\r\\nI never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\\r\\nbeing eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\r\\nexplained:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\\r\\nago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\\r\\nrequiring early attention.  It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\\r\\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\\r\\npleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that\\r\\nmentioned.  Pray do not talk of that odious man.  I do think it is\\r\\nthe hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed\\r\\naway from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I\\r\\nshould have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\r\\nThey had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on\\r\\nwhich Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she\\r\\ncontinued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling and estate\\r\\naway from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom\\r\\nnobody cared anything about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\r\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\\r\\nLongbourn.  But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\\r\\nbe a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent\\r\\nof him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.  I hate such\\r\\nfalse friends.  Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as\\r\\nhis father did before him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\\r\\nthat head, as you will hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                      \"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\\r\\n                                                   \"15th October.\\r\\n\"Dear Sir,--\\r\\n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\\r\\nhonoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I\\r\\nhave had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to\\r\\nheal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own\\r\\ndoubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for\\r\\nme to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always\\r\\npleased him to be at variance,--  \\'There, Mrs. Bennet.\\'-- My\\r\\nmind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\r\\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\r\\ndistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose\\r\\nbounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory\\r\\nof this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean\\r\\nmyself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever\\r\\nready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted\\r\\nby the Church of England.  As a clergyman,  moreover, I feel it\\r\\nmy duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all\\r\\nfamilies within in the reach of my influence; and on these\\r\\ngrounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly\\r\\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\\r\\nentail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\\r\\nside, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.  I\\r\\ncannot otherwise than be concerned at being the means of\\r\\ninjuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\\r\\nit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every\\r\\npossible amends-- but of this hereafter.  If you should have no\\r\\nobjection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the\\r\\nsatisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\\r\\nNovember 18th, by four o\\'clock, and shall probably trespass on\\r\\nyour hospitality till the Saturday se\\'ennight following, which I\\r\\ncan do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from\\r\\nobjecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that\\r\\nsome other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.-- I\\r\\nremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\\r\\ndaughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\r\\n                                   \"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\\r\\ngentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.  \"He\\r\\nseems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon\\r\\nmy word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\\r\\nespecially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him\\r\\ncome to us again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\\r\\nand if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the\\r\\nperson to discourage him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can\\r\\nmean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\\r\\ncertainly to his credit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\\r\\nLady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\\r\\nand burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she.  \"I cannot make him\\r\\nout.  There is something very pompous in his style.  And what\\r\\ncan he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?  We\\r\\ncannot suppose he would help it if he could.  Could he be a\\r\\nsensible man, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, I think not.  I have great hopes of finding him\\r\\nquite the reverse.  Thee is a mixture of servility and\\r\\nself-importance in his letter, which promises well.  I am\\r\\nimpatient to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not seem\\r\\ndefective.  The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\\r\\nnew, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in\\r\\nany degree interesting.  It was next to impossible that their\\r\\ncousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some\\r\\nweeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a\\r\\nman in any other colour.  As for their mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter\\r\\nhad done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see\\r\\nhim with a degree of composure which astonished her husband\\r\\nand daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with\\r\\ngreat politeness by the whole family.  Mr. Bennet indeed said\\r\\nlittle; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins\\r\\nseemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be\\r\\nsilent himself.  He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\\r\\nfive-and-twenty.  His air was grave and stately, and his manners\\r\\nwere very formal. He had not been long seated before he\\r\\ncomplimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\r\\ndaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in\\r\\nthis instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that\\r\\nhe did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in\\r\\nmarriage.  This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of\\r\\nhis hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no\\r\\ncompliments, answered most readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\\r\\nmay prove so, for else they will be destitute enough.  Things are\\r\\nsettled so oddly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\r\\nmust confess.  Not that I mean to find fault with YOU, for such\\r\\nthings I know are all chance in this world.  There is no knowing\\r\\nhow estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\\r\\nand could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\\r\\nappearing forward and precipitate.  But I can assure the young\\r\\nladies that I come prepared to admire them.  At present I will\\r\\nnot say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\\r\\non each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collin\\'s\\r\\nadmiration.  The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were\\r\\nexamined and praised; and his commendation of everything\\r\\nwould have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s heart, but for the mortifying\\r\\nsupposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.  The\\r\\ndinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to\\r\\nknow to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking\\r\\nwas owing.  But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\r\\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to\\r\\nkeep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in\\r\\nthe kitchen.  He begged pardon for having displeased her.  In a\\r\\nsoftened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he\\r\\ncontinued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the\\r\\nservants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some\\r\\nconversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\\r\\nwhich he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed\\r\\nvery fortunate in his patroness.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\'s\\r\\nattention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort,\\r\\nappeared very remarkable.  Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\r\\nbetter.  Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.  The subject\\r\\nelevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a\\r\\nmost important aspect he protested that \"he had never in his life\\r\\nwitnessed such behaviour in a person of rank-- such affability\\r\\nand condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  She had been graciously pleased to approve of both\\r\\nof the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\r\\npreaching before her.  She had also asked him twice to dine at\\r\\nRosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make\\r\\nup her pool of quadrille in the evening.  Lady Catherine was\\r\\nreckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never\\r\\nseen anything but affability in her.  She had always spoken to\\r\\nhim as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the\\r\\nsmallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\r\\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a\\r\\nweek or two, to visit his relations.  She had even condescended\\r\\nto advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose\\r\\nwith discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble\\r\\nparsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\r\\nhe had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\\r\\nherself-- some shelves in the closet upstairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.  It is a pity that\\r\\ngreat ladies in general are not more like her.  Does she live near\\r\\nyou, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only\\r\\nby a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir?  Has she any family?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\r\\nextensive property.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off\\r\\nthan many girls.  And what sort of young lady is she?  Is she\\r\\nhandsome?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine\\r\\nherself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far\\r\\nsuperior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in\\r\\nher features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\r\\nShe is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented\\r\\nher from making that progress in many accomplishments which\\r\\nshe could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the\\r\\nlady who superintended her education, and who still resides with\\r\\nthem.  But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to\\r\\ndrive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among\\r\\nthe ladies at court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\\r\\ntown; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has\\r\\ndeprived the British court of its brightest ornaments.  Her\\r\\nladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that\\r\\nI am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate\\r\\ncompliments which are always acceptable to ladies.  I have more\\r\\nthan once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming\\r\\ndaughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\r\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be\\r\\nadorned by her.  These are the kind of little things which please\\r\\nher ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself\\r\\npeculiarly bound to pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for\\r\\nyou that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.  May I\\r\\nask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse\\r\\nof the moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though\\r\\nI sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such\\r\\nlittle elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary\\r\\noccasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered.  His cousin was\\r\\nas absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the\\r\\nkeenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most\\r\\nresolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional\\r\\nglance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr.\\r\\nBennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again,\\r\\nand, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the\\r\\nladies.  Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced;\\r\\nbut, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a\\r\\ncirculating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\r\\nprotested that he never read novels.  Kitty stared at him, and\\r\\nLydia exclaimed.  Other books were produced, and after some\\r\\ndeliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons.  Lydia gaped as he\\r\\nopened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous\\r\\nsolemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning\\r\\naway Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.  My\\r\\naunt told me so herself on Saturday.  I shall walk to Meryton\\r\\nto-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny\\r\\ncomes back from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but\\r\\nMr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\\r\\nbooks of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.\\r\\nIt amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so\\r\\nadvantageous to them as instruction.  But I will no longer\\r\\nimportune my young cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist\\r\\nat backgammon.  Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing\\r\\nthat he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling\\r\\namusements.  Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most\\r\\ncivilly for Lydia\\'s interruption, and promised that it should not\\r\\noccur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after\\r\\nassuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and\\r\\nshould never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself\\r\\nat another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for\\r\\nbackgammon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature\\r\\nhad been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest\\r\\npart of his life having been spent under the guidance of an\\r\\nilliterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of\\r\\nthe universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without\\r\\nforming at it any useful acquaintance.  The subjection in which\\r\\nhis father had brought him up had given him originally great\\r\\nhumility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by\\r\\nthe self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the\\r\\nconsequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.  A\\r\\nfortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\r\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect\\r\\nwhich he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his\\r\\npatroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his\\r\\nauthority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him\\r\\naltogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness,\\r\\nself-importance and humility.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he\\r\\nintended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the\\r\\nLongbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose\\r\\none of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable\\r\\nas they were represented by common report.  This was his plan\\r\\noff amends-- of atonement-- for inheriting their father\\'s estate;\\r\\nand he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\r\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his\\r\\nown part.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.  Miss Bennet\\'s lovely face\\r\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of\\r\\nwhat was due to seniority; and for the first evening SHE was his\\r\\nsettled choice.  The next morning, however, made an alteration;\\r\\nfor in a quarter of an hour\\'s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before\\r\\nbreakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house,\\r\\nand leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress\\r\\nmight be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid\\r\\nvery complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution\\r\\nagainst the very Jane he had fixed on.  \"As to her YOUNGER\\r\\ndaughters, she could not take upon her to say-- she could not\\r\\npositively answer-- but she did not KNOW of any prepossession;\\r\\nher ELDEST daughter, she must just mention-- she felt it\\r\\nincumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth-- and it\\r\\nwas soon done-- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\\r\\nElizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded\\r\\nher of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might\\r\\nsoon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could\\r\\nnot bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good\\r\\ngraces.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten;\\r\\nevery sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most\\r\\nanxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for\\r\\nthither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he\\r\\nwould continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios\\r\\nin the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little\\r\\ncessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.  Such doings\\r\\ndiscomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.  In his library he had been\\r\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as\\r\\nhe told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other\\r\\nroom of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\\r\\ncivility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to\\r\\njoin his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact\\r\\nmuch better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely\\r\\npleased to close his large book, and go.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\r\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.  The\\r\\nattention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by\\r\\nhim.  Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in\\r\\nquest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet\\r\\nindeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\\r\\nwhom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike\\r\\nappearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the\\r\\nway.  The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose\\r\\nreturn from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as\\r\\nthey passed.  All were struck with the stranger\\'s air, all\\r\\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\\r\\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense\\r\\nof wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had\\r\\njust gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back,\\r\\nhad reached the same spot.  Mr. Denny addressed them directly,\\r\\nand entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nwho had returned with him the day before from town, and he\\r\\nwas happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.\\r\\nThis was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only\\r\\nregimentals to make him completely charming.  His appearance\\r\\nwas greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a\\r\\nfine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.  The\\r\\nintroduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of\\r\\nconversation-- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\r\\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking\\r\\ntogether very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their\\r\\nnotice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.\\r\\nOn distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen\\r\\ncame directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.\\r\\nBingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\r\\nprincipal object.  He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn\\r\\non purpose to inquire after her.  Mr. Darcy corroborated it with\\r\\na bow, an was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on\\r\\nElizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\r\\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of\\r\\nboth as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the\\r\\neffect of the meeting.  Both changed colour, one looked white,\\r\\nthe other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his\\r\\nhat-- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What\\r\\ncould be the meaning of it?  It was impossible to imagine; it was\\r\\nimpossible not to long to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have\\r\\nnoticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to\\r\\nthe door of Mr. Phillip\\'s house, and then made their bows, in\\r\\nspite of Miss Lydia\\'s pressing entreaties that they should come\\r\\nin, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips\\'s throwing up the parlour\\r\\nwindow and loudly seconding the invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two\\r\\neldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and\\r\\nshe was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return\\r\\nhome, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she\\r\\nshould have known nothing about, if she had not happened to\\r\\nsee Mr. Jones\\'s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that\\r\\nthey were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because\\r\\nthe Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was\\r\\nclaimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\'s introduction of him.  She\\r\\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned\\r\\nwith as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any\\r\\nprevious acquaintance with her, which he could not help\\r\\nflattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship\\r\\nto the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.  Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but\\r\\nher contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by\\r\\nexclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however,\\r\\nshe could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.\\r\\nDenny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\r\\nlieutenant\\'s commission in the ----shire.  She had been watching\\r\\nhim the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,\\r\\nand had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly\\r\\nhave continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed\\r\\nwindows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison\\r\\nwith the stranger, were become \"stupid, disagreeable fellows.\"\\r\\nSome of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and\\r\\ntheir aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nand give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\r\\nwould come in the evening.  This was agreed to, and Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy\\r\\ngame of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.\\r\\nThe prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted\\r\\nin mutual good spirits.  Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in\\r\\nquitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that\\r\\nthey were perfectly needless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had\\r\\nseen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would\\r\\nhave defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the\\r\\nwrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by\\r\\nadmiring Mrs. Phillips\\'s manners and politeness.  He protested\\r\\nthat, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen\\r\\na more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with\\r\\nthe utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her\\r\\ninvitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her\\r\\nbefore.  Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\r\\nconnection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\\r\\nattention in the whole course of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs no objection was made to the young people\\'s engagement\\r\\nwith their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\\r\\nsteadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at\\r\\na suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nhad accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their\\r\\nseats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\\r\\nand he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\\r\\napartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed\\r\\nhimself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a\\r\\ncomparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but\\r\\nwhen Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and\\r\\nwho was its proprietor-- when she had listened to the description\\r\\nof only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found that\\r\\nthe chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt\\r\\nall the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented\\r\\na comparison with the housekeeper\\'s room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\\r\\nmansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\\r\\nabode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\\r\\nemployed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his\\r\\nconsequence increased with what she heard, and who was\\r\\nresolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she\\r\\ncould.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and\\r\\nwho had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and\\r\\nexamine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\\r\\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It was\\r\\nover at last, however.  The gentlemen did approach, and when\\r\\nMr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had\\r\\nneither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with\\r\\nthe smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of\\r\\nthe ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set,\\r\\nand the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.\\r\\nWickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air,\\r\\nand walk, as THEY were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy\\r\\nuncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every\\r\\nfemale eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by\\r\\nwhom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in\\r\\nwhich he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only\\r\\non its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest,\\r\\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by\\r\\nthe skill of the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\\r\\nthe officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\\r\\nthe young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\\r\\nintervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\\r\\nwatchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\r\\nWhen the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\\r\\nobliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be\\r\\nglad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nwas very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his\\r\\nreason.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\r\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At first\\r\\nthere seemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she\\r\\nwas a most determined talked; but being likewise extremely fond\\r\\nof lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\\r\\ngame, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\\r\\nhave attention for anyone in particular.  Allowing for the\\r\\ncommon demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at\\r\\nleisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\r\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\r\\ntold-- the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.  She dared\\r\\nnot even mention that gentleman.  Her curiosity, however, was\\r\\nunexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.\\r\\nHe inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after\\r\\nreceiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr.\\r\\nDarcy had been staying there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\\r\\nsubject drop, added, \"he is a man of very large property in\\r\\nDerbyshire, I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one.  A\\r\\nclear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with a\\r\\nperson more capable of giving you certain information on that\\r\\nhead than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a\\r\\nparticular manner from my infancy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\\r\\nafter seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\\r\\nmeeting yesterday.  Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly.  \"I\\r\\nhave spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him\\r\\nvery disagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no right to give MY opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his\\r\\nbeing agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form one.  I\\r\\nhave known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.  It is\\r\\nimpossible for ME to be impartial.  But I believe your opinion of\\r\\nhim would in general astonish-- and perhaps you would not\\r\\nexpress it quite so strongly anywhere else.  Here you are in your\\r\\nown family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in any\\r\\nhouse in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at all\\r\\nliked in Hertfordshire.  Everybody is disgusted with his pride.\\r\\nYou will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\r\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated\\r\\nbeyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often\\r\\nhappen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence,\\r\\nor frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him\\r\\nonly as he chooses to be seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\n ill-tempered man.\"  Wickham shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\\r\\n\"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going away\\r\\nwhen I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the\\r\\n----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no-- it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.  If\\r\\nHE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go.  We are not on\\r\\nfriendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\\r\\nhave no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim\\r\\nbefore all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\\r\\npainful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthe late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\\r\\nand the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\\r\\nwith this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\r\\nthousand tender recollections.  His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\\r\\ndisgracing  the memory of his father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened\\r\\nwith all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton,\\r\\nthe neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\\r\\nthat he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\\r\\nvery intelligible gallantry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he\\r\\nadded, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.  I\\r\\nknew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend\\r\\nDenny tempted me further by his account of their present\\r\\nquarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\\r\\nacquaintances Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is\\r\\nnecessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\\r\\nwill not bear solitude.  I MUST have employment and society.\\r\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\\r\\nhave now made it eligible.  The church OUGHT to have been\\r\\nmy profession-- I was brought up for the church, and I should at\\r\\nthis time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\\r\\npleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation\\r\\nof the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and\\r\\nexcessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his kindness.\\r\\nHe meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it;\\r\\nbut when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could THAT be?\\r\\nHow could his will be disregarded?  Why did you not seek legal\\r\\nredress?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\\r\\nas to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not\\r\\nhave doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it-- or\\r\\nto treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert\\r\\nthat I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--\\r\\nin short anything or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became\\r\\nvacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and\\r\\nthat it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I\\r\\ncannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve\\r\\nto lose it.  I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have\\r\\nspoken my opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely.  I can recall\\r\\nnothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different sort of\\r\\nmen, and that he hates me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is quite shocking!  He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some time or other he WILL be-- but it shall not be by ME.\\r\\nTill I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose HIM.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\\r\\nhandsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?\\r\\nWhat can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me-- a dislike which I cannot\\r\\nbut attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had the late Mr.\\r\\nDarcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better;\\r\\nbut his father\\'s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I\\r\\nbelieve, very early in life.  He had not a temper to bear the sort of\\r\\ncompetition in which we stood-- the sort of preference which\\r\\nwas often given me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this-- though I have\\r\\nnever liked him.  I had not thought so very ill of him.  I had\\r\\nsupposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but\\r\\ndid not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge,\\r\\nsuch injustice, such inhumanity as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I DO\\r\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\\r\\nimplacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\\r\\ntemper.  His disposition must be dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\ncan hardly be just to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\\r\\n\"to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of\\r\\nhis father!\"  She could have added, \"a young man, too, like\\r\\nYOU, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\\r\\namiable\"-- but she contented herself with, \"and one, too, who\\r\\nhad probably been his companion from childhood, connected\\r\\ntogether, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\\r\\ngreatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\\r\\nsame house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\\r\\nparental care.  MY father began life in the profession which your\\r\\nuncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to-- but he\\r\\ngave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and\\r\\ndevoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.  He\\r\\nwas most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate,\\r\\nconfidential friend.  Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be\\r\\nunder the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active\\r\\nsuperintendence, and when, immediately before my father\\'s\\r\\ndeath, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for\\r\\nme, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of\\r\\ngratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"How abominable!  I wonder\\r\\nthat the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to\\r\\nyou!  If from no better motive, that he should not have been too\\r\\nproud to be dishonest-- for dishonesty I must call it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It IS wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions\\r\\nmay be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\r\\nIt has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\\r\\nfeeling.  But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\\r\\nto me there were stronger impulses even than pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his\\r\\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and\\r\\nrelieve the poor.  Family pride, and FILIAL pride-- for he is very\\r\\nproud of what his father was-- have done this.  Not to appear to\\r\\ndisgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or\\r\\nlose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.\\r\\nHe has also BROTHERLY pride, which, with SOME brotherly\\r\\naffection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his\\r\\nsister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most\\r\\nattentive and best of brothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.  \"I wish I could call her amiable.  It gives me\\r\\npain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too much like her\\r\\nbrother-- very, very proud.  As a child, she was affectionate and\\r\\npleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours\\r\\nand hours to her amusement.  But she is nothing to me now.\\r\\nShe is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I\\r\\nunderstand, highly accomplished.  Since her father\\'s death, her\\r\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\\r\\nsuperintends her education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!  How can Mr.\\r\\nBingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\\r\\ntruly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?  How can they\\r\\nsuit each other?  Do you know Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.  He cannot\\r\\nknow what Mr. Darcy is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.  He\\r\\ndoes not want abilities.  He can be a conversible companion if he\\r\\nthinks it worth his while.  Among those who are at all his equals\\r\\nin consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\\r\\nless prosperous.  His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\\r\\nhe is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\\r\\nperhaps agreeable-- allowing something for fortune and figure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players\\r\\ngathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station\\r\\nbetween his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.  The usual\\r\\ninquiries as to his success was made by the latter.  It had not\\r\\nbeen very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nbegan to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with\\r\\nmuch earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that\\r\\nhe considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she\\r\\nwould not make herself uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down\\r\\nto a card table, they must take their chances of these things, and\\r\\nhappily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings\\r\\nany object.  There are undoubtedly many who could not say the\\r\\nsame, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed\\r\\nfar beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr,.\\r\\nCollins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\\r\\nwhether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\\r\\nfamily of de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given\\r\\nhim a living.  I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first\\r\\nintroduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her\\r\\nlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady\\r\\nAnne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the\\r\\npresent Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.  I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nconnections.  I never heard of her existence till the day before\\r\\nyesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\\r\\nand it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\\r\\nestates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\\r\\nMiss Bingley.  Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\\r\\nuseless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he\\r\\nwere already self-destined for another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine\\r\\nand her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\\r\\nof her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in\\r\\nspite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\nhave not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that\\r\\nI never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\\r\\ninsolent.  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible\\r\\nand clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\\r\\nfrom her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\\r\\nand the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that\\r\\nevery one connected with him should have an understanding of\\r\\nthe first class.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it,\\r\\nand they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till\\r\\nsupper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their\\r\\nshare of Mr. Wickham\\'s attentions.  There could be no\\r\\nconversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\\'s supper party, but his\\r\\nmanners recommended him to everybody.  Whatever he said,\\r\\nwas said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwent away with her head full of him.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nbut of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way\\r\\nhome; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\r\\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.\\r\\nLydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost\\r\\nand the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the\\r\\ncivility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the\\r\\nleast regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at\\r\\nsupper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had\\r\\nmore to say than he could well manage before the carriage\\r\\nstopped at Longbourn House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between\\r\\nMr. Wickham and herself.  Jane listened with astonishment and\\r\\nconcern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be\\r\\nso unworthy of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her\\r\\nnature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable\\r\\nappearance as Wickham.  The possibility of his having endured\\r\\nsuch unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings;\\r\\nand nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of\\r\\nthem both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the\\r\\naccount of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise\\r\\nexplained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some\\r\\nway or other, of which we can form no idea.  Interested people\\r\\nhave perhaps misrepresented each to the other.  It is, in short,\\r\\nimpossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances\\r\\nwhich may have alienated them, without actual blame on either\\r\\nside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got\\r\\nto say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been\\r\\nconcerned in the business?  Do clear THEM too, or we shall be\\r\\nobliged to think ill of somebody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of\\r\\nmy opinion.  My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a\\r\\ndisgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\'s\\r\\nfavourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to\\r\\nprovide for.  It is impossible.  No man of common humanity, no\\r\\nman who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.\\r\\nCan his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?\\r\\nOh! no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on,\\r\\nthan that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as\\r\\nhe gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned\\r\\nwithout ceremony.  If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.\\r\\nBesides, there was truth in his looks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is difficult indeed-- it is distressing.  One does not know what\\r\\nto think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point-- that Mr.\\r\\nBingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much to suffer\\r\\nwhen the affair became public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery,\\r\\nwhere this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very\\r\\npersons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his\\r\\nsisters came to give their personal invitation for the\\r\\nlong-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the\\r\\nfollowing Tuesday.  The two ladies were delighted to see their\\r\\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\\r\\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since\\r\\ntheir separation.  To the rest of the family they paid little\\r\\nattention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not\\r\\nmuch to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.  They were\\r\\nsoon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which\\r\\ntook their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to\\r\\nescape from Mrs. Bennet\\'s civilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to\\r\\nevery female of the family.  Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as\\r\\ngiven in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly\\r\\nflattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,\\r\\ninstead of a ceremonious card.  Jane pictured to herself a happy\\r\\nevening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of\\r\\nher brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a\\r\\ngreat deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of\\r\\neverything in Mr. Darcy\\'s look and behavior.  The happiness\\r\\nanticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\r\\nevent, or any particular person, for though they each, like\\r\\nElizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nhe was be no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\\r\\na ball was, at any rate, a ball.  And even Mary could assure her\\r\\nfamily that she had no disinclination for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is\\r\\nenough-- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening\\r\\nengagements.  Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself\\r\\none of hose who consider intervals of recreation and amusement\\r\\nas desirable for everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she\\r\\ndid not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not\\r\\nhelp asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\'s\\r\\ninvitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join\\r\\nin the evening\\'s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find\\r\\nthat he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was\\r\\nvery far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a\\r\\nball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to\\r\\nrespectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far\\r\\nfrom objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\\r\\nhonoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of\\r\\nthe evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss\\r\\nElizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which\\r\\nI trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to\\r\\nany disrespect for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in.  She had fully\\r\\nproposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances;\\r\\nand to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been\\r\\nworse times.  There was no help for it, however.  Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little\\r\\nlonger, and Mr. Collins\\' proposal accepted with as good a grace\\r\\nas she could.  She was not better the pleased with his gallantry\\r\\nfrom the idea it suggested of something more.  It now first\\r\\nstruck her, that SHE was selected from among her sisters as\\r\\nworthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of\\r\\nassisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of\\r\\nmore eligible visitors.  The idea soon reached to conviction, as\\r\\nshe observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard\\r\\nhis frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and\\r\\nthough more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of\\r\\nher charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to\\r\\nunderstand that the probability of their marriage was extremely\\r\\nagreeable to HER.  Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take\\r\\nthe hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\r\\nconsequence of any reply.  Mr. Collins might never make the\\r\\noffer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk\\r\\nof, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable\\r\\nstate at this time, for form the day of the invitation, to the day of\\r\\nthe ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their\\r\\nwalking to Meryton once.  No aunt, no officers, no news could\\r\\nbe sought after-- the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by\\r\\nproxy.  Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her\\r\\npatience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of\\r\\nher acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a\\r\\ndance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday,\\r\\nSunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and\\r\\nlooked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats\\r\\nthere assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred\\r\\nto her.  The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by\\r\\nany of those recollections that might not unreasonably have\\r\\nalarmed her.  She had dressed with more than usual care, and\\r\\nprepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that\\r\\nremained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more\\r\\nthan might be won in the course of the evening.  But in an\\r\\ninstant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely\\r\\nomitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s pleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the\\r\\nofficers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute\\r\\nfact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to\\r\\nwhom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham\\r\\nhad been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and\\r\\nwas not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, \"I do not\\r\\nimagine his business would have called him away just now, if he\\r\\nhad not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\\r\\ncaught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\\r\\nless answerable for Wickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise\\r\\nhad been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former\\r\\nwas so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could\\r\\nhardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which\\r\\nhe directly afterwards approached to make.  Attendance,\\r\\nforbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.  She\\r\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\\r\\nturned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not\\r\\nwholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind\\r\\npartiality provoked her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\\r\\nprospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not\\r\\ndwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was\\r\\nsoon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her\\r\\ncousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.  The first\\r\\ntwo dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\r\\ndances of mortification.  Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\r\\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong\\r\\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery\\r\\nwhich disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.  The\\r\\nmoment of her release from him was ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of\\r\\ntalking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\r\\nWhen those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas,\\r\\nand was in conversation with her, when she found herself\\r\\nsuddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by\\r\\nsurprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing\\r\\nwhat she did, she accepted him.  He walked away again\\r\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of\\r\\npresence of mind;  Charlotte tried to console her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven forbid!  THAT would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\r\\nTo find a man agreeable whom on is determined to hate!  Do not\\r\\nwish me such an evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy\\r\\napproached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help\\r\\ncautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her\\r\\nfancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of\\r\\na man ten times his consequence.  Elizabeth made no answer,\\r\\nand took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she\\r\\nwas arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nand reading in her neighbours\\' looks, their equal amazement in\\r\\nbeholding it.  They stood for some time without speaking a\\r\\nword; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last\\r\\nthrough the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it;\\r\\ntill suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to\\r\\nher partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight\\r\\nobservation on the dance.  He replied, and was again silent.\\r\\nAfter a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\r\\nwith:-- \"It is YOUR turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\ntalked about the dance, and YOU ought to make some sort of\\r\\nremark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\\r\\nshould be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  That reply will do for the present.  Perhaps by and\\r\\nby I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than\\r\\npublic ones.  But NOW we may be silent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It would look\\r\\nodd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the\\r\\nadvantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so arranged, as\\r\\nthat they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\\r\\nyou imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\r\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.  We are each of an unsocial,\\r\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\r\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down\\r\\nto posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I\\r\\nam sure,\" said he.  \"How near it may be to MINE, I cannot\\r\\npretend to say.  YOU think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\\r\\ndown the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not\\r\\nvery often walk to Meryton?  She answered in the affirmative,\\r\\nand, unable to resist the temptation, added, \"When you met us\\r\\nthere the other day, we had just been forming a new\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect was immediate.  A deeper shade of hauteur\\r\\noverspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth,\\r\\nthough blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.\\r\\nAt length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, \"Mr.\\r\\nWickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\\r\\nMAKING friends-- whether he may be equally capable of\\r\\nRETAINING them, is less certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to\\r\\nsuffer from all his life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the\\r\\nsubject.  At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to\\r\\nthem, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the\\r\\nroom; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of\\r\\nsuperior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his\\r\\npartner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.  Such\\r\\nvery superior dancing is not often seen.  It is evident that you\\r\\nbelong to the first circles.  Allow me to say, however, that your\\r\\nfair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have\\r\\nthis pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable\\r\\nevent, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall\\r\\ntake place.  What congratulations will then flow in!  I appeal to\\r\\nMr. Darcy:-- but let me not interrupt you, sir.  You will not\\r\\nthank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\r\\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\\r\\nSir William\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly,\\r\\nand his eyes were directed with a very serious expression\\r\\ntowards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\r\\nRecovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,\\r\\nand said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what\\r\\nwe were talking of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all.  Sir William could not\\r\\nhave interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for\\r\\nthemselves.  We have tried two or three subjects already without\\r\\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Books-- oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with\\r\\nthe same feelings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at\\r\\nleast be no want of subject.  We may compare our different\\r\\nopinions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always\\r\\nfull of something else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes-- does it?\"\\r\\nsaid he, with a look of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for\\r\\nher thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\\r\\nafterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember\\r\\nhearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,\\r\\nthat you resentment once created was unappeasable.  You are\\r\\nvery cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING CREATED.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their\\r\\nopinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character,\" said she,\\r\\nendeavouring to shake off her gravity.  \"I am trying to make it\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.  \"I do not get on at all.  I hear such\\r\\ndifferent accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may\\r\\nvary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthat you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,\\r\\nas there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no\\r\\ncredit on either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have\\r\\nanother opportunity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly\\r\\nreplied.  She said no more, and they went down the other dance\\r\\nand parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to\\r\\nan equal degree, for in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerable\\r\\npowerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon,\\r\\nand directed all his anger against another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards\\r\\nher, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:-- \"So,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\\r\\nWickham!  Your sister has been talking to me about him, and\\r\\nasking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man\\r\\nquite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he\\r\\nwas the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\\'s steward.  Let\\r\\nme recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\\r\\nconfidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\'s using him\\r\\nill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been\\r\\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\r\\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.  I do not know the\\r\\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\\r\\nleast to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\\r\\nmentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could\\r\\nnot well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\r\\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\\r\\nway.  His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\\r\\nindeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.  I pity you,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really,\\r\\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\r\\nsame,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him\\r\\nof nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward,\\r\\nand of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\\r\\nsneer.  \"Excuse my interference: it was kindly meant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.  \"You are much\\r\\nmistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack\\r\\nas this.  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\\r\\nmalice of Mr. Darcy.\"  She then sought her eldest sister, who\\r\\nhas undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.\\r\\nJane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of\\r\\nsuch happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\r\\nsatisfied with the occurrences of the evening.  Elizabeth instantly\\r\\nread her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham,\\r\\nresentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\r\\nbefore the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling\\r\\nthan her sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.\\r\\nBut perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of\\r\\nany third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\nsatisfactory to tell you.  Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\r\\nhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\r\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good\\r\\nconduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly\\r\\nconvinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention\\r\\nfrom Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by\\r\\nhis account as well as his sister\\'s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a\\r\\nrespectable young man.  I am afraid he has been very imprudent,\\r\\nand has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\nam satisfied.  But what does he say of the living?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\\r\\nheard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that\\r\\nit was left to him CONDITIONALLY only.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth\\r\\nwarmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by\\r\\nassurances only.  Mr. Bingley\\'s defense of his friend was a very\\r\\nable one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several\\r\\nparts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend\\r\\nhimself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\\r\\nand on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\\r\\nElizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest\\r\\nhopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard, and said\\r\\nall in her power to heighten her confidence in it.  On their being\\r\\njoined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss\\r\\nLucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner\\r\\nshe had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\r\\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so\\r\\nfortunate as to make a most important discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is\\r\\nnow in the room a near relation of my patroness.  I happened to\\r\\noverhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady\\r\\nwho does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss\\r\\nde Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How\\r\\nwonderfully these sort of things occur!  Who would have\\r\\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh in his assembly!  I am most thankful that\\r\\nthe discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him,\\r\\nwhich I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not\\r\\nhaving done it before.  My total ignorance of the connection\\r\\nmust plead my apology.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I am.  I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it\\r\\nearlier.  I believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s NEPHEW.  It will\\r\\nbe in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well\\r\\nyesterday se\\'nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme,\\r\\nassuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him\\r\\nwithout introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a\\r\\ncompliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary\\r\\nthere should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it\\r\\nmust belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin\\r\\nthe acquaintance.  Mr. Collins listened to her with the\\r\\ndetermined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\r\\nceased speaking, replied thus:-- \"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have\\r\\nthe highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in\\r\\nall matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit\\r\\nme to say, that there must be a wide difference between the\\r\\nestablished forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\\r\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I\\r\\nconsider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the\\r\\nhighest rank in the kingdom-- provided that a proper humility of\\r\\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore\\r\\nallow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this\\r\\noccasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point\\r\\nof duty.  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,\\r\\nwhich on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\\r\\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\\r\\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady\\r\\nlike yourself.\"  And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched,\\r\\nand whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.\\r\\nHer cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though\\r\\nshe could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and\\r\\nsaw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\"\\r\\nand \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"  It vexed her to see him\\r\\nexpose himself to such a man.  Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\r\\nunrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\r\\ntime to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.  Mr. Collins,\\r\\nhowever, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\\r\\nof his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\\r\\nslight bow, and moved another way.  Mr. Collins then returned\\r\\nto Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with\\r\\nmy reception.  Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\\r\\nattention.  He answered me with the utmost civility, and even\\r\\npaid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be certain she could never\\r\\nbestow a favour unworthily.  It was really a very handsome\\r\\nthought.  Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue,\\r\\nshe turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\r\\nBingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her\\r\\nobservations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\\r\\nJane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\\r\\nfelicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\\r\\nfelt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\\r\\nlike Bingley\\'s two sisters.  Her mother\\'s thoughts she plainly saw\\r\\nwere bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\\r\\nher, lest she might hear too much.  When they sat down to\\r\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness\\r\\nwhich placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she\\r\\nvexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person\\r\\n(Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her\\r\\nexpectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley.  It\\r\\nwas an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of\\r\\nfatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.  His\\r\\nbeing such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\r\\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\\r\\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters\\r\\nwere of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the\\r\\nconnection as much as she could do.  It was, moreover, such a\\r\\npromising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so\\r\\ngreatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly,\\r\\nit was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her\\r\\nsingle daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be\\r\\nobliged to go into company more than she liked.  It was\\r\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure,\\r\\nbecause on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less\\r\\nlikely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any\\r\\nperiod of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that\\r\\nLady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate,  though evidently\\r\\nand triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\\r\\nmother\\'s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less\\r\\naudible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could\\r\\nperceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who\\r\\nsat opposite to them.  Her mother only scolded her for being\\r\\nnonsensical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?\\r\\nI am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged\\r\\nto say nothing HE may not like to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it\\r\\nbe for you to offend Mr. Darcy?  You will never recommend\\r\\nyourself to his friend by so doing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence.  Her\\r\\nmother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\r\\nElizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.\\r\\nShe could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nthough every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for\\r\\nthough he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\r\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.  The\\r\\nexpression of his face changed gradually from indignant\\r\\ncontempt to a composed and steady gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\\r\\nLucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights\\r\\nwhich she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts\\r\\nof cold ham and chicken.  Elizabeth now began to revive.  But\\r\\nnot long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was\\r\\nover, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of\\r\\nseeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\\r\\ncompany.  By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did\\r\\nshe endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in\\r\\nvain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\r\\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations,\\r\\nand she watched her progress through the several stanzas with\\r\\nan impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for\\r\\nMary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a\\r\\nhope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after\\r\\nthe pause of half a minute began another.  Mary\\'s powers were\\r\\nby no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and\\r\\nher manner affected.  Elizabeth was in agonies.  She looked at\\r\\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\r\\ntalking to Bingley.  She looked at his two sisters, and saw them\\r\\nmaking signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who\\r\\ncontinued, however, imperturbably grave.  She looked at her\\r\\nfather to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all\\r\\nnight.  He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second\\r\\nsong, said aloud, \"That will do extremely well, child.  You have\\r\\ndelighted us long enough.  Let the other young ladies have time\\r\\nto exhibit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat\\r\\ndisconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her\\r\\nfather\\'s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.\\r\\nOthers of the party were now applied to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing,\\r\\nI should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company\\r\\nwith an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion,\\r\\nand perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.  I\\r\\ndo not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in\\r\\ndevoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly\\r\\nother things to be attended to.  The rector of a parish has much\\r\\nto do.  In the first place, he must make such an agreement for\\r\\ntithes as a may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his\\r\\npatron.  He must write his own sermons; and the time that\\r\\nremains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\r\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused\\r\\nfrom making as a comfortable as a possible.  And I do not think\\r\\nit of light importance that he should have attentive and\\r\\nconciliatory manner towards everybody, especially towards\\r\\nthose to whom he owes his preferment.  I cannot acquit him of\\r\\nthat duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\r\\noccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected\\r\\nwith the family.\"  And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\\r\\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as a to be heard by\\r\\nhalf the room.  Many stared-- many smiled; but no one looked\\r\\nmore amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously\\r\\ncommended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and\\r\\nobserved in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a\\r\\nremarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\\r\\nto expose themselves as a much as a they could during the\\r\\nevening, it would have been impossible for them to play their\\r\\nparts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it\\r\\nfor Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had\\r\\nescaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be\\r\\nmuch distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.\\r\\nThat his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such\\r\\nan opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and\\r\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\r\\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more\\r\\nintolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement.  She was\\r\\nteased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her\\r\\nside, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him\\r\\nagain, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In vain did\\r\\nshe entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to\\r\\nintroduce him to any young lady in the room.  He assured her,\\r\\nthat as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his\\r\\nchief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\r\\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close\\r\\nto her the whole evening.  There was no arguing upon such a\\r\\nproject.  She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas,\\r\\nwho often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s conversation to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\\'s further\\r\\nnotice; though often standing within a very short distance of her,\\r\\nquite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.  She felt\\r\\nit to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\r\\nWickham, and rejoiced in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\\r\\nand, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their\\r\\ncarriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,\\r\\nwhich gave them time to see how heartily they were wished\\r\\naway by some of the family.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely\\r\\nopened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were\\r\\nevidently impatient to have the house to themselves.  They\\r\\nrepulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by\\r\\nso doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very\\r\\nlittle relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was\\r\\ncomplimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of\\r\\ntheir entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had\\r\\nmarked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing at all.\\r\\nMr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.  Mr.\\r\\nBingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from\\r\\nthe rest, and talked only to each other.  Elizabeth preserved as\\r\\nsteady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even\\r\\nLydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional\\r\\nexclamation of \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a\\r\\nviolent yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\\r\\npressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at\\r\\nLongbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to\\r\\nassure him how happy he would make them by eating a family\\r\\ndinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal\\r\\ninvitation.  Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily\\r\\nengaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,\\r\\nafter his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the\\r\\nnext day for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under\\r\\nthe delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary\\r\\npreparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,\\r\\nshe should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in\\r\\nthe course of three or four months.  Of having another daughter\\r\\nmarried to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and\\r\\nwith considerable, though not equal, pleasure.  Elizabeth was the\\r\\nleast dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the\\r\\nmatch were quite good enough for HER, the worth of each was\\r\\neclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmade his declaration in form.  Having resolved to do it without\\r\\nloss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the\\r\\nfollowing Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make\\r\\nit distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a\\r\\nvery orderly manner, with all the observances, which he\\r\\nsupposed a regular part of the business.  On finding Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\r\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \"May I\\r\\nhope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter\\r\\nElizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience\\r\\nwith her in the course of this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!-- yes-- certainly.  I\\r\\nam sure Lizzy will be very happy-- I am sure she can have no\\r\\nobjection, Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.\"  And, gathering\\r\\nher work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\r\\ncalled out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam, do not go.  I beg you will not go.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmust excuse me.  He can have nothing to say to me that anybody\\r\\nneed not hear.  I am going away myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.  I desire you to stay where you are.\"\\r\\nAnd upon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and\\r\\nembarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I\\r\\nINSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth would not oppose such and injunction-- and a\\r\\nmoment\\'s consideration making her also sensible that it would\\r\\nbe wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat\\r\\ndown again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the\\r\\nfeelings which were divided between distress and diversion.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were\\r\\ngone, Mr. Collins began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far\\r\\nfrom doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\\r\\nperfections.  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had\\r\\nthere NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure\\r\\nyou, that I have your respected mother\\'s permission for this\\r\\naddress.  You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,\\r\\nhowever your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\r\\nattentions have been too marked to be mistaken.  Almost as\\r\\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion\\r\\nof my future life.  But before I am run away with by my feelings\\r\\non this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state\\r\\nmy reasons for marrying-- and, moreover, for coming into\\r\\nHertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being\\r\\nrun away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing,\\r\\nthat she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt\\r\\nto stop him further, and he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing\\r\\nfor every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set\\r\\nthe example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am\\r\\nconvinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and\\r\\nthirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it\\r\\nis the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble\\r\\nlady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has\\r\\nshe condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\r\\nsubject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\r\\nHunsford-- between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson\\r\\nwas arranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said,  \\'Mr.\\r\\nCollins, you must marry.  A clergyman like you must marry.\\r\\nChoose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY sake; and for\\r\\nyour OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought\\r\\nup high, but able to make a small income go a good way.  This is\\r\\nmy advice.  Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to\\r\\nHunsford, and I will visit her.\\'  Allow me, by the way, to\\r\\nobserve, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\r\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\r\\nadvantages in my power to offer.  You will find her manners\\r\\nbeyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I\\r\\nthink, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with\\r\\nthe silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.\\r\\nThus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it\\r\\nremains to be told why my views were directed towards\\r\\nLongbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can\\r\\nassure you there are many amiable young women.  But the fact\\r\\nis, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of\\r\\nyour honoured father (who, however, may live many years\\r\\nlonger), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a\\r\\nwife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as\\r\\nlittle as possible, when the melancholy event takes place-- which,\\r\\nhowever, as I have already said, may not be for several years.\\r\\nThis has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it\\r\\nwill not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing remains but\\r\\nfor me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\r\\nviolence of my affection.  To fortune I am perfectly indifferent,\\r\\nand shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I\\r\\nam well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one\\r\\nthousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours\\r\\ntill after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be\\r\\nentitled to.  On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent;\\r\\nand you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall\\r\\never pass my lips when we are married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried.  \"You forget that I have\\r\\nmade no answer.  Let me do it without further loss of time.\\r\\nAccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.  I am\\r\\nvery sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\\r\\nof the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the\\r\\naddresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when\\r\\nhe first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is\\r\\nrepeated a second, or even a third time.  I am therefore by no\\r\\nmeans discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to\\r\\nlead you to the altar ere long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\r\\nextraordinary one after my declaration.  I do assure you that I\\r\\nam not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)\\r\\nwho are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of\\r\\nbeing asked a second time.  I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\r\\nYou could not make ME happy, and I am convinced that I am\\r\\nthe last woman in the world who could make you so.  Nay, were\\r\\nyour friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she\\r\\nwould find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr.\\r\\nCollins very gravely-- \"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship\\r\\nwould at all disapprove of you.  And you may be certain when I\\r\\nhave the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very\\r\\nhighest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable\\r\\nqualification.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.  You\\r\\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the\\r\\ncompliment of believing what I say.  I wish you very happy and\\r\\nvery rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to\\r\\nprevent your being otherwise.  In making me the offer, you must\\r\\nhave satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my\\r\\nfamily, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever\\r\\nit falls, without any self-reproach.  This matter may be\\r\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.\"  And rising as she thus\\r\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not\\r\\nthus addressed her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the\\r\\nsubject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than\\r\\nyou have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of\\r\\ncruelty at present, because I know it to be the established\\r\\ncustom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and\\r\\nperhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit\\r\\nas would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\r\\ncharacter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you\\r\\npuzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have hitherto said can appear\\r\\nto you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express\\r\\nmy refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that\\r\\nyour refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.  My\\r\\nreasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to\\r\\nme that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the\\r\\nestablishment I can offer would be any other than highly\\r\\ndesirable.  My situation in life, my connections with the family of\\r\\nde Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances\\r\\nhighly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by\\r\\nno means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be\\r\\nmade you.  Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all\\r\\nlikelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable\\r\\nqualifications.  As I must therefore conclude that you are not\\r\\nserious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to\\r\\nyour wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the\\r\\nusual practice of elegant females.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that\\r\\nkind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.\\r\\nI would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.\\r\\nI thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in\\r\\nyour proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.  My\\r\\nfeelings in every respect forbid it.  Can I speak plainer?  Do not\\r\\nconsider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you,\\r\\nbut as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\r\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the\\r\\nexpress authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals\\r\\nwill not fail of being acceptable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\\r\\nmake no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew,\\r\\ndetermined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated\\r\\nrefusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father,\\r\\nwhose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be\\r\\ndecisive, and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for\\r\\nthe affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\\r\\nvestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\\r\\nElizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards\\r\\nthe staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and\\r\\ncongratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy\\r\\nprospect or their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and\\r\\nreturned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\r\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the\\r\\nresult of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied,\\r\\nsince the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him\\r\\nwould naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine\\r\\ndelicacy of her character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would\\r\\nhave been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had\\r\\nmeant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but\\r\\nshe dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall\\r\\nbe brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it directly.  She\\r\\nis a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own\\r\\ninterest but I will MAKE her know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins;\\r\\n\"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether\\r\\nshe would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\\r\\nsituation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\\r\\nstate.  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\\r\\nperhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\\r\\nbecause if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\\r\\ncontribute much to my felicity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\\r\\n\"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In everything\\r\\nelse she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.  I will go directly\\r\\nto Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am\\r\\nsure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\\r\\nher husband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh! Mr.\\r\\nBennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\r\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows\\r\\nshe will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will\\r\\nchange his mind and not have HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\\r\\nfixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in\\r\\nthe least altered by her communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when\\r\\nshe had finished her speech.  \"Of what are you talking?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have\\r\\nLizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?  It seems an hopeless\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist upon\\r\\nher marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to\\r\\nthe library.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared.  \"I have\\r\\nsent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr.\\r\\nCollins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?\"  Elizabeth\\r\\nreplied that it was.  \"Very well-- and this offer of marriage you\\r\\nhave refused?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists\\r\\nupon your accepting it.  Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this day\\r\\nyou must be a stranger to one of your parents.  Your mother will\\r\\nnever see you again if you do NOT marry Mr. Collins, and I will\\r\\nnever see you again if you DO.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\\r\\nbeginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\\r\\nhusband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\\r\\ndisappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?  You\\r\\npromised me to INSIST upon her marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to\\r\\nrequest.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my\\r\\nunderstanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my\\r\\nroom.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as\\r\\nmay be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\\r\\ndid Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to Elizabeth again\\r\\nand again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.  She endeavoured\\r\\nto secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\\r\\nmildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\\r\\nreal earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\\r\\nher attacks.  Though her manner varied, however, her\\r\\ndetermination never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\\r\\npassed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\\r\\nmotives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\\r\\nhurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was quite\\r\\nimaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\'s\\r\\nreproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\\r\\nspend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\\r\\nwho, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are\\r\\ncome, for there is such fun here!  What do you think has\\r\\nhappened this morning?  Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy,\\r\\nand she will not have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\\r\\nKitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\\r\\nentered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than\\r\\nshe likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\\r\\ncompassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\\r\\ncomply with the wishes of all her family.  \"Pray do, my dear\\r\\nMiss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on\\r\\nmy side, nobody takes part with me.  I am cruelly used, nobody\\r\\nfeels for my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as\\r\\nunconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we\\r\\nwere at York, provided she can have her own way.  But I tell\\r\\nyou, Miss Lizzy-- if you take it into your head to go on refusing\\r\\nevery offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband\\r\\nat all-- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  I shall not be able to keep you--\\r\\nand so I warn you.  I have done with you from this very day.  I\\r\\ntold you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to\\r\\nyou again, and you will find me as good as my word.  I have no\\r\\npleasure in talking to undutiful children.  Not that I have much\\r\\npleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.  People who suffer as I\\r\\ndo from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for\\r\\ntalking.  Nobody can tell what I suffer!  But it is always so.\\r\\nThose who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\r\\nany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only\\r\\nincrease the irritation.  She talked on, therefore, without\\r\\ninterruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.\\r\\nCollins, who entered the room with an air more stately than\\r\\nusual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \"Now, I do\\r\\ninsist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me\\r\\nand Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\\r\\nfollowed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\\r\\ncould; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nwhose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute,\\r\\nand then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the\\r\\nwindow and pretending not to hear.  In a doleful voice Mrs.\\r\\nBennet began the projected conversation: \"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam, \" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this\\r\\npoint.  Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that\\r\\nmarked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter.\\r\\nResignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the\\r\\npeculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\\r\\nhave been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.\\r\\nPerhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive\\r\\nhappiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\\r\\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when\\r\\nthe blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\r\\nestimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\\r\\ndisrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing\\r\\nmy pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without having paid\\r\\nyourself and Mr. Bennet to compliment of requesting you to\\r\\ninterpose your authority in my behalf.  My conduct may, I fear,\\r\\nbe objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\\r\\ndaughter\\'s lips instead of your own.  But we are all liable to\\r\\nerror.  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.  My\\r\\nobject has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\\r\\ndue consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my\\r\\nMANNER has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\\r\\napologise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end,\\r\\nand Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\nnecessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish\\r\\nallusions of her mother.  As for the gentleman himself, HIS\\r\\nfeelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or\\r\\ndejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner\\r\\nand resentful silence.  He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\\r\\nassiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\\r\\nwere transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\r\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\r\\nespecially to her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\'s ill-humour\\r\\nor ill health.  Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry\\r\\npride.  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his\\r\\nvisit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.  He\\r\\nwas always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant\\r\\nto stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.\\r\\nWickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from\\r\\nthe Netherfield ball.  He joined them on their entering the town,\\r\\nand attended them to their aunt\\'s where his regret and vexation,\\r\\nand the concern of everybody, was well talked over.  To\\r\\nElizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the\\r\\nnecessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not\\r\\nmeet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party\\r\\nwith him for so many hours together, might be more than I could\\r\\nbear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\\r\\nfull discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they\\r\\ncivilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer\\r\\nwalked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he\\r\\nparticularly attended to her.  His accompanying them was a\\r\\ndouble advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to\\r\\nherself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing\\r\\nhim to her father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it\\r\\ncame from Netherfield.  The envelope contained a sheet of\\r\\nelegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair,\\r\\nflowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change\\r\\nas she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular\\r\\npassages.  Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter\\r\\naway, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general\\r\\nconversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which\\r\\ndrew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had\\r\\nhe and he companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\r\\ninvited her to follow her upstairs.  When they had gained their\\r\\nown room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, \"This is from\\r\\nCaroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\r\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\r\\ntheir way to town-- and without any intention of coming back\\r\\nagain.  You shall hear what she says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the\\r\\ninformation of their having just resolved to follow their brother\\r\\nto town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet, where Mr. Hurst had a house.  The next was in these\\r\\nwords: \"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in\\r\\nHertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we\\r\\nwill hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\r\\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\r\\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\r\\nunreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that.\"  To\\r\\nthese highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the\\r\\ninsensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their\\r\\nremoval surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it\\r\\nwas not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield\\r\\nwould prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as to the loss of\\r\\ntheir society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard\\r\\nit, in the enjoyment of his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should\\r\\nnot be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\r\\nBut may we not hope that the period of future happiness to\\r\\nwhich Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is\\r\\naware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as\\r\\nfriends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?\\r\\nMr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\r\\nHertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to you:\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the\\r\\nbusiness which took him to London might be concluded in three\\r\\nor four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the\\r\\nsame time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be\\r\\nin no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following\\r\\nhim thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours\\r\\nin a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintances are already\\r\\nthere for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest\\r\\nfriend, had any intention of making one of the crowd-- but of\\r\\nthat I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire\\r\\nmay abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings,\\r\\nand that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your\\r\\nfeeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more\\r\\nthis winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\\r\\nSHOULD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why will you think so?  It must be his own doing.  He is his\\r\\nown master.  But you do not know ALL.  I WILL read you the\\r\\npassage which particularly hurts me.  I will have no reserves\\r\\nfrom YOU.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the\\r\\ntruth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again.  I really do\\r\\nnot think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,\\r\\nand accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa\\r\\nand myself is heightened into something still more interesting,\\r\\nfrom the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our\\r\\nsister.  I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you\\r\\nmy feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country\\r\\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\r\\nunreasonable.  My brother admires her greatly already; he will\\r\\nhave frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most\\r\\nintimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as\\r\\nhis own; and a sister\\'s partiality is not misleading me, I think,\\r\\nwhen I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\'s\\r\\nheart.  With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and\\r\\nnothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging\\r\\nthe hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said\\r\\nJane as she finished it.  \"Is it not clear enough?  Does it not\\r\\nexpressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to\\r\\nbe her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s\\r\\nindifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for\\r\\nhim, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?  Can\\r\\nthere be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.  Will you hear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou shall have it in a few words.  Miss Bingley sees that her\\r\\nbrother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\r\\nShe follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries\\r\\nto persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.  No one who has ever\\r\\nseen you together can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley, I am\\r\\nsure, cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.  Could she have seen\\r\\nhalf as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have\\r\\nordered her wedding clothes.  But the case is this: We are not\\r\\nrich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more\\r\\nanxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\\r\\nwhen there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less\\r\\ntrouble in achieving a second: in which there is certainly some\\r\\ningenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nwere out of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously\\r\\nimagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly\\r\\nadmires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of\\r\\nYOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or\\r\\nthat it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being\\r\\nin love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\r\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy.  But I know\\r\\nthe foundation is unjust.  Caroline is incapable of wilfully\\r\\ndeceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she\\r\\nis deceiving herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right.  You could not have started a more happy idea,\\r\\nsince you will not take comfort in mine.  Believe her to be\\r\\ndeceived, by all means.  You have now done your duty by her,\\r\\nand must fret no longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\r\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to\\r\\nmarry elsewhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon\\r\\nmature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his\\r\\ntwo sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his\\r\\nwife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling.  \"You must\\r\\nknow that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their\\r\\ndisapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot\\r\\nconsider your situation with much compassion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\r\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the\\r\\nutmost contempt.  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of\\r\\nCaroline\\'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment\\r\\nsuppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,\\r\\ncould influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\r\\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy\\r\\neffect.  Jane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was\\r\\ngradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\\r\\nsometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\\r\\nNetherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure\\r\\nof the family, without being alarmed on the score of the\\r\\ngentleman\\'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave\\r\\nher a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly\\r\\nunlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they\\r\\nwere all getting so intimate together.  After lamenting it,\\r\\nhowever, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\r\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at\\r\\nLongbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable\\r\\ndeclaration, that though he had been invited only to a family\\r\\ndinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again\\r\\nduring the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to\\r\\nMr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.  \"It\\r\\nkeeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to\\r\\nyou than I can express.\"  Charlotte assured her friend of her\\r\\nsatisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the\\r\\nlittle sacrifice of her time.  This was very amiable, but\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any\\r\\nconception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\r\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins\\'s addresses, by engaging them\\r\\ntowards herself.  Such was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and\\r\\nappearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night,\\r\\nshe would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been\\r\\nto leave Hertfordshire so very soon.  But here she did injustice\\r\\nto the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to\\r\\nescape out of Longbourn House the next morning with\\r\\nadmirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself\\r\\nat her feet.  He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\r\\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail\\r\\nto conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the\\r\\nattempt known till its success might be known likewise; for\\r\\nthough feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had\\r\\nbeen tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since\\r\\nthe adventure of Wednesday.  His reception, however, was of\\r\\nthe most flattering kind.  Miss Lucas perceived him from an\\r\\nupper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set\\r\\nout to meet him accidentally in the lane.  But little had she dared\\r\\nto hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\\'s long speeches would allow,\\r\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;\\r\\nand as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name\\r\\nthe day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though\\r\\nsuch a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt\\r\\nno inclination to trifle with his happiness.  The stupidity with\\r\\nwhich he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from\\r\\nany charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance;\\r\\nand Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\\r\\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\r\\nestablishment were gained.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their\\r\\nconsent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.  Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for\\r\\ntheir daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his\\r\\nprospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nbegan directly to calculate, with more interest than the\\r\\nmatter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.\\r\\nBennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\r\\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\r\\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\\r\\nhis wife should make their appearance at St. James\\'s. The whole\\r\\nfamily, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.  The\\r\\nyounger girls formed hopes of COMING OUT a year or two\\r\\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were\\r\\nrelieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s dying an old\\r\\nmaid.  Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.  She had\\r\\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it.  Her reflections\\r\\nwere in general satisfactory.  Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither\\r\\nsensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\\r\\nattachment to her must be imaginary.  But still he would be her\\r\\nhusband.  Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\\r\\nmarriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\\r\\nfor well-educated young women of small fortune, and however\\r\\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\r\\npreservative from want.  This preservative she had now\\r\\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever\\r\\nbeen handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.  The least\\r\\nagreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must\\r\\noccasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued\\r\\nbeyond that of any other person.  Elizabeth would wonder, and\\r\\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to\\r\\nbe shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.\\r\\nShe resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore\\r\\ncharged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\\r\\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.  A\\r\\npromise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it\\r\\ncould not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by\\r\\nhis long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his\\r\\nreturn as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the\\r\\nsame time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\r\\npublish his prosperous love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see\\r\\nany of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed\\r\\nwhen the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with\\r\\ngreat politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to\\r\\nsee him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might\\r\\nallow him to visit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\r\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\r\\nyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no\\r\\nmeans wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation\\r\\nhere, my good sir?  You had better neglect your relations than\\r\\nrun the risk of offending your patroness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins,\" I am particularly obliged to\\r\\nyou for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not\\r\\ntaking so material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard.  Risk anything\\r\\nrather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by\\r\\nyour coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly\\r\\nprobable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that WE shall\\r\\ntake no offence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited, by\\r\\nsuch affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily\\r\\nreceive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other\\r\\nmark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.  As for my\\r\\nfair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to\\r\\nrender it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them\\r\\nhealth and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them\\r\\nequally surprised that he meditated a quick return.  Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwished to understand by it that he thought of paying his\\r\\naddresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been\\r\\nprevailed on to accept him.  She rated his abilities much higher\\r\\nthan any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections\\r\\nwhich often struck her, and though by no means so clever as\\r\\nherself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve\\r\\nhimself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\r\\nagreeable companion.  But on the following morning, every\\r\\nhope of this kind was done away.  Miss Lucas called soon after\\r\\nbreakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the\\r\\nevent of the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying herself in love with her\\r\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two;\\r\\nbut that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far\\r\\nfrom possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her\\r\\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first\\r\\nthe bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins!  My dear Charlotte-- impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in\\r\\ntelling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on\\r\\nreceiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than\\r\\nshe expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?  Do you think it\\r\\nincredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any\\r\\nwoman\\'s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to\\r\\nsucceed with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong\\r\\neffort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the\\r\\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that\\r\\nshe wished her all imaginable happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte.  \"You must be\\r\\nsurprised, very much surprised-- so lately as Mr. Collins was\\r\\nwishing to marry you.  But when you have had time to think it\\r\\nover, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.  I am\\r\\nnot romantic, you know; I never was.  I ask only a comfortable\\r\\nhome; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s character, connection, and\\r\\nsituation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness\\r\\nwith him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the\\r\\nmarriage state.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly\"; and after an\\r\\nawkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\\r\\nCharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left\\r\\nto reflect on what she had heard.  It was a long time before she\\r\\nbecame at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.\\r\\nThe strangeness of Mr. Collins\\'s making two offers of marriage\\r\\nwithin three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\r\\naccepted.  She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of\\r\\nmatrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not\\r\\nsupposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she\\r\\nwould have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.\\r\\nCharlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture!\\r\\nAnd to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her\\r\\nesteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was\\r\\nimpossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\r\\nchosen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\\r\\nwhat she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\\r\\nmention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\\r\\ndaughter, to announce her engagement to the family.  With many\\r\\ncompliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect\\r\\nof a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter-- to\\r\\nan audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he\\r\\nmust be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\r\\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?  Do not\\r\\nyou know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have\\r\\nborne without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good\\r\\nbreeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave\\r\\nto be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all\\r\\ntheir impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\\r\\nunpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\\r\\naccount, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\\r\\nherself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\\r\\nmother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\\r\\nSir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\\r\\nmaking a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\\r\\nexpected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nand the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great\\r\\ndeal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them\\r\\nthan her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she\\r\\npersisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\\r\\nwas very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\\r\\ntrusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\\r\\nthat the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however,\\r\\nwere plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was\\r\\nthe real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had\\r\\nbeen barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points\\r\\nshe principally dwelt during the rest of the day.  Nothing could\\r\\nconsole and nothing could appease her.  Nor did that day wear\\r\\nout her resentment.  A week elapsed before she could see\\r\\nElizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she\\r\\ncould speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude,\\r\\nand many months were gone before she could at all forgive her\\r\\ndaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the\\r\\noccasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of\\r\\na most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover\\r\\nthat Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\\r\\nsensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\\r\\ndaughter!\\r\\n\\r\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\r\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their\\r\\nhappiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as\\r\\nimprobable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\\r\\nfor Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\\r\\nother way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\\r\\nretort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\\r\\nmarried; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual\\r\\nto say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\\'s sour looks and\\r\\nill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which\\r\\nkept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt\\r\\npersuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between\\r\\nthem again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with\\r\\nfonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she\\r\\nwas sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose\\r\\nhappiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been\\r\\ngone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\\r\\ncounting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\r\\nThe promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\\r\\nTuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\\r\\nsolemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\'s abode in the\\r\\nfamily might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience\\r\\non that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\\r\\nexpressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\\r\\ntheir amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\\r\\nwas merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\\r\\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again\\r\\nat Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\\r\\nfortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved\\r\\nhis marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\\r\\nwhich he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\\r\\namiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\r\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much\\r\\ndisposed to complain of it as her husband.  It was very strange\\r\\nthat he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\\r\\nwas also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.  She\\r\\nhated having visitors in the house while her health was so\\r\\nindifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.\\r\\nSuch were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave\\r\\nway only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\'s continued\\r\\nabsence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.\\r\\nDay after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of\\r\\nhim than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his\\r\\ncoming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which\\r\\nhighly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to\\r\\ncontradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear-- not that Bingley was indifferent--\\r\\nbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\r\\nUnwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s\\r\\nhappiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\\r\\ncould not prevent its frequently occurring.  The united efforts of\\r\\nhis two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted\\r\\nby the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London\\r\\nmight be too much, she feared, for the strength of his\\r\\nattachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\\r\\nmore painful than Elizabeth\\'s, but whatever she felt she was\\r\\ndesirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\\r\\ntherefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such\\r\\ndelicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\\r\\nshe did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival,\\r\\nor even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she\\r\\nwould think herself very ill used.  It needed all Jane\\'s steady\\r\\nmildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but\\r\\nhis reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had\\r\\nbeen on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however, to\\r\\nneed much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of\\r\\nlove-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.\\r\\nThe chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\\r\\nsometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an\\r\\napology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very\\r\\nmention of anything concerning the match threw her into an\\r\\nagony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of\\r\\nhearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.\\r\\nAs her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous\\r\\nabhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she\\r\\nconcluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\r\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was\\r\\nconvinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and\\r\\nresolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as\\r\\nsoon as Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of all\\r\\nthis to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I\\r\\nshould be forced to make way for HER, and live to see her take\\r\\nher place in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.  Let us\\r\\nhope for better things.  Let us flatter ourselves that I may be\\r\\nthe survivor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead\\r\\nof making any answer, she went on as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.  If it\\r\\nwas not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\r\\ninsensibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\\r\\nentail.  How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\\r\\nestate from one\\'s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all\\r\\nfor the sake of Mr. Collins too!  Why should HE have it more\\r\\nthan anybody else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The very\\r\\nfirst sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in\\r\\nLondon for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret\\r\\nat not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\\r\\nHertfordshire before he left the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\\r\\nrest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection\\r\\nof the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss Darcy\\'s\\r\\npraise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions were again\\r\\ndwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing\\r\\nintimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the\\r\\nwishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.  She wrote\\r\\nalso with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an inmate of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the\\r\\nlatter with regard to new furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of\\r\\nall this, heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided\\r\\nbetween concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.\\r\\nTo Caroline\\'s assertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss\\r\\nDarcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she\\r\\ndoubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\\r\\nalways been disposed to like him, she could not think without\\r\\nanger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\\r\\nwant of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\\r\\ndesigning friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\r\\nto the caprice of their inclination.  Had his own happiness,\\r\\nhowever, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\\r\\nsport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister\\'s\\r\\nwas involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.  It\\r\\nwas a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long\\r\\nindulged, and must be unavailing.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nelse; and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really died away, or\\r\\nwere suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether he had\\r\\nbeen aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\r\\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\\r\\nmust be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s\\r\\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\\r\\nfeelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them\\r\\ntogether, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\\r\\nand its master, she could not help saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!  She\\r\\ncan have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\\r\\nreflections on him.  But I will not repine.  It cannot last long.  He\\r\\nwill be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\\r\\nsaid nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you\\r\\nhave no reason.  He may live in my memory as the most amiable\\r\\nman of my acquaintance, but that is all.  I have nothing either to\\r\\nhope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.  Thank God! I\\r\\nhave not THAT pain. A little time, therefore-- I shall certainly\\r\\ntry to get the better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort\\r\\nimmediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\\r\\nmy side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.  Your\\r\\nsweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\\r\\nwhat to say to you.  I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\\r\\nloved you as you deserve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and\\r\\nthrew back the praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair.  YOU wish to think all\\r\\nthe world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I\\r\\nonly want to think YOU perfect, and you set yourself against it.\\r\\nDo not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my\\r\\nencroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.  You need\\r\\nnot.  There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of\\r\\nwhom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I\\r\\ndissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the\\r\\ninconsistency of all human characters, and of the little\\r\\ndependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\r\\nsense.  I have met with two instances lately, one I will not\\r\\nmention; the other is Charlotte\\'s marriage.  It is unaccountable!\\r\\nIn every view it is unaccountable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.  They\\r\\nwill ruin your happiness.  You do not make allowance enough\\r\\nfor difference of situation and temper.  Consider Mr. Collins\\'s\\r\\nrespectability, and Charlotte\\'s steady, prudent character.\\r\\nRemember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it\\r\\nis a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\\'s\\r\\nsake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our\\r\\ncousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\\r\\none else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\\r\\npersuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\\r\\nthink worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.\\r\\nMy dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-\\r\\nminded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must\\r\\nfeel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot\\r\\nhave a proper way of thinking.  You shall not defend her, though\\r\\nit is Charlotte Lucas.  You shall not, for the sake of one\\r\\nindividual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor\\r\\nendeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is\\r\\nprudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I musty think your language too strong in speaking of both,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\\r\\nthem happy together.  But enough of this.  You alluded to\\r\\nsomething else.  You mentioned TWO instances.  I cannot\\r\\nmisunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me\\r\\nby thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your opinion\\r\\nof him is sunk.  We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves\\r\\nintentionally injured.  We must not expect a lively young man to\\r\\nbe always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing\\r\\nbut our own vanity that deceives us.  Women fancy admiration\\r\\nmeans more than it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no\\r\\nidea of there being so much design in the world as some persons\\r\\nimagine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to\\r\\ndesign,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or\\r\\nto make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be\\r\\nmisery.  Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\'s\\r\\nfeelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying\\r\\nwhat I think of persons you esteem Stop me whilst you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence him?\\r\\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no\\r\\nother woman can secure it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your first position is false.  They may wish many things besides\\r\\nhis happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\\r\\nconsequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\\r\\nimportance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are\\r\\nsupposing.  They have known her much longer than they have\\r\\nknown me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever\\r\\nmay be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have\\r\\nopposed their brother\\'s.  What sister would think herself at\\r\\nliberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?\\r\\nIf they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part\\r\\nus; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an\\r\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong,\\r\\nand me most unhappy.  Do not distress me by the idea.  I am not\\r\\nashamed of having been mistaken-- or, at least, it is light, it is\\r\\nnothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him\\r\\nor his sisters.  Let me take it in the best light, in the light in\\r\\nwhich it may be understood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\r\\nBingley\\'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\\r\\nno more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\\r\\nnot account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\\r\\nconsidering it with less perplexity.  Her daughter endeavoured to\\r\\nconvince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\\r\\nattentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\\r\\ntransient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\\r\\nthough the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\\r\\nshe had the same story to repeat every day.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s best\\r\\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the\\r\\nsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently.  \"So, Lizzy,\" said he\\r\\none day, \"your sister is crossed in love, I find.  I congratulate\\r\\nher.  Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in\\r\\nlove now and then.  It is something to think of, and it gives her a\\r\\nsort of distinction among her companions.  When is your turn to\\r\\ncome?  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is\\r\\nyour time.  Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\\r\\nthe young ladies in the country.  Let Wickham be your man.  He\\r\\nis a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.  We\\r\\nmust not all expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that\\r\\nwhatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\\r\\nmother who will make the most of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the\\r\\ngloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many\\r\\nof the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other\\r\\nrecommendations was now added that of general unreserve.\\r\\nThe whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on\\r\\nMr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now\\r\\nopenly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody\\r\\nwas pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr.\\r\\nDarcy before they had known anything of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there\\r\\nmight be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to\\r\\nthe society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\\r\\npleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--\\r\\nbut by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 25\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\\r\\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival\\r\\nof Saturday.  The pain of separation, however, might be\\r\\nalleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his\\r\\nbride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into\\r\\nHertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.  He took leave of his relations at Longbourn\\r\\nwith as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health\\r\\nand happiness again, and promised their father another letter of\\r\\nthanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\\r\\nreceiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend\\r\\nthe Christmas at Longbourn.  Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by\\r\\nnature as education.  The Netherfield ladies would have had\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within\\r\\nview of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and\\r\\nagreeable.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent,\\r\\nelegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn\\r\\nnieces.  Between the two eldest and herself especially, there\\r\\nsubsisted a particular regard.  They had frequently been staying\\r\\nwith her in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s business on her arrival was to\\r\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.  When\\r\\nthis was done she had a less active part to play.  It became her\\r\\nturn to listen.  Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and\\r\\nmuch to complain of.  They had all been very ill-used since she\\r\\nlast saw her sister.  Two of her girls had been upon the point of\\r\\nmarriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got\\r\\nMr. Bingley if she could.  But Lizzy!  Oh, sister!  It is very hard\\r\\nto think that she might have been Mr. Collins\\'s wife by this time,\\r\\nhad it not been for her own perverseness.  He made her an offer\\r\\nin this very room, and she refused him.  The consequence of it is,\\r\\nthat Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and\\r\\nthat the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.  The\\r\\nLucases are very artful people indeed, sister.  They are all for\\r\\nwhat they can get.  I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.  It\\r\\nmakes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own\\r\\nfamily, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before\\r\\nanybody else.  However, your coming just at this time is the\\r\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us,\\r\\nof long sleeves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given\\r\\nbefore, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence\\r\\nwith her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to\\r\\nher nieces, turned the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the\\r\\nsubject.  \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\\r\\nJane,\" said she.  \"I am sorry it went off.  But these things happen\\r\\nso often!  A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so\\r\\neasily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when\\r\\naccident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of\\r\\ninconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will\\r\\nnot do for US.  We do not suffer by accident.  It does not often\\r\\nhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young\\r\\nman of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he\\r\\nwas violently in love with only a few days before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so\\r\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.  It is as\\r\\noften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\\'s\\r\\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.  Pray, how\\r\\nVIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley\\'s love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\r\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.  Every\\r\\ntime they met, it was more decided and remarkable.  At his own\\r\\nball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them\\r\\nto dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an\\r\\nanswer. Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not general incivility\\r\\nthe very essence of love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\r\\nPoor Jane!  I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she\\r\\nmay not get over it immediately.  It had better have happened to\\r\\nYOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\r\\nBut do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with\\r\\nus?  Change of scene might be of service-- and perhaps a little\\r\\nrelief from home may be as useful as anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt\\r\\npersuaded of her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with\\r\\nregard to this young man will influence her.  We live in so\\r\\ndifferent a part of town, all our connections are so different, and,\\r\\nas you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable\\r\\nthat they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of\\r\\nhis friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on\\r\\nJane in such a part of London!  My dear aunt, how could you\\r\\nthink of it?  Mr. Darcy may perhaps have HEARD of such a\\r\\nplace as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a\\r\\nmonth\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were\\r\\nhe once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs\\r\\nwithout him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at all.  But does\\r\\nnot Jane correspond with his sister?  SHE will not be able to\\r\\nhelp calling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place\\r\\nthis point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s\\r\\nbeing withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the\\r\\nsubject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not\\r\\nconsider it entirely hopeless.  It was possible, and sometimes she\\r\\nthought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and\\r\\nthe influence of his friends successfully combated by the more\\r\\nnatural influence of Jane\\'s attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and\\r\\nthe Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time,\\r\\nthan as she hoped by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house\\r\\nwith her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with\\r\\nher, without any danger of seeing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\\r\\nPhillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day\\r\\nwithout its engagement.  Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided\\r\\nfor the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not\\r\\nonce sit down to a family dinner.  When the engagement was for\\r\\nhome, some of the officers always made part of it-- of which\\r\\nofficers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these\\r\\noccasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nwarm commendation, narrowly observed them both.  Without\\r\\nsupposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love,\\r\\ntheir preference of each other was plain enough to make her a\\r\\nlittle uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the\\r\\nsubject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the\\r\\nimprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording\\r\\npleasure, unconnected with his general powers.  About ten or a\\r\\ndozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a\\r\\nconsiderable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he\\r\\nbelonged.  They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common;\\r\\nand though Wickham had been little there since the death of\\r\\nDarcy\\'s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\\r\\nintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\\r\\nprocuring.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberly, and known the late Mr. Darcy\\r\\nby character perfectly well.  Here consequently was an\\r\\ninexhaustible subject of discourse.  In comparing her recollection\\r\\nof Pemberly with the minute description which Wickham could\\r\\ngive, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of\\r\\nits late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.  On\\r\\nbeing made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\'s treatment\\r\\nof him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\\'s reputed\\r\\ndisposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was\\r\\nconfident at last that she recollected having heard Mr.\\r\\nFitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured\\r\\nboy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 26\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\\r\\ngiven on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her\\r\\nalone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\\r\\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of\\r\\nspeaking openly.  Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.\\r\\nDo not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an\\r\\naffection which the want of fortune would make so very\\r\\nimprudent.  I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a most\\r\\ninteresting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to\\r\\nhave, I should think you could not do better.  But as it is, you\\r\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you.  You have sense, and\\r\\nwe all expect you to use it.  Your father would depend on\\r\\nYOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure.  You must not\\r\\ndisappoint your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.  I will take care of\\r\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too.  He shall not be in love with\\r\\nme, if I can prevent it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again.  At present I am not in love\\r\\nwith Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.  But he is, beyond all\\r\\ncomparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw-- and if he\\r\\nbecomes really attached to me-- I believe it will be better that he\\r\\nshould not.  I see the imprudence of it.  Oh! THAT abominable\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  My father\\'s opinion of me does me the greatest\\r\\nhonour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.  My father,\\r\\nhowever, is partial to Mr. Wickham.  In short, my dear aunt, I\\r\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you\\r\\nunhappy; but since we see every day that where there is\\r\\naffection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want\\r\\nof fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how\\r\\ncan I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if\\r\\nI am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be\\r\\nwisdom  to resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\\r\\nto be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\\r\\nobject.  When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.\\r\\nIn short, I will do my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so\\r\\nvery often.  At least, you should not REMIND you mother of\\r\\ninviting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\\r\\n\"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT.  But do\\r\\nnot imagine that he is always here so often.  It is on your\\r\\naccount that he has been so frequently invited this week.  You\\r\\nknow my mother\\'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company\\r\\nfor her friends.  But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do\\r\\nwhat I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\\r\\nher for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful\\r\\ninstance of advice being given on such a point, without being\\r\\nresented.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been\\r\\nquitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode\\r\\nwith the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\r\\nBennet.  His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at\\r\\nlength so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even\\r\\nrepeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \"WISHED they\\r\\nmight be happy.\"  Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on\\r\\nWednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\\r\\nrose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s\\r\\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected\\r\\nherself, accompanied her out of the room.  As they went\\r\\ndownstairs together, Charlotte said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT you certainly shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I have another favour to ask you.  Will you come and see\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.  Promise me,\\r\\ntherefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in\\r\\nthe visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added\\r\\nCharlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\\r\\nIndeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding took place:  the bride and bridegroom set off for\\r\\nKent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say,\\r\\nor to hear, on the subject as usual.  Elizabeth soon heard from\\r\\nher friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent\\r\\nas it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was\\r\\nimpossible.  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling\\r\\nthat all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined\\r\\nnot to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what\\r\\nhad been, rather than what was.  Charlotte\\'s first letters were\\r\\nreceived with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\r\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how\\r\\nshe would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare\\r\\npronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read,\\r\\nElizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point\\r\\nexactly as she might have foreseen.  She wrote cheerfully,\\r\\nseemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which\\r\\nshe could not praise.  The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\r\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was\\r\\nmost friendly and obliging.  It was Mr. Collins\\'s picture of\\r\\nHunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth\\r\\nperceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the\\r\\nrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce\\r\\ntheir safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth\\r\\nhoped it would be in her power to say something of the\\r\\nBingleys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as\\r\\nimpatience generally is.  Jane had been a week in town without\\r\\neither seeing or hearing from Caroline.  She accounted for it,\\r\\nhowever, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from\\r\\nLongbourn had by some accident been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of\\r\\nthe town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\\r\\nBingley.  \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words,\\r\\n\"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving\\r\\nher no notice of my coming to London.  I was right, therefore,\\r\\nmy last letter had never reached her.  I inquired after their\\r\\nbrother, of course.  He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\r\\nDarcy that they scarcely ever saw him.  I found that Miss Darcy\\r\\nwas expected to dinner.  I wish I could see her.  My visit was\\r\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.  I dare say\\r\\nI shall see them soon here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter.  It convinced her that\\r\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\'s being in\\r\\ntown.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.  She\\r\\nendeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but\\r\\nshe could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention.  After\\r\\nwaiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing\\r\\nevery evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last\\r\\nappear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration\\r\\nof her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.\\r\\nThe letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\\r\\nprove what she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\r\\nher better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to\\r\\nhave been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me.\\r\\nBut, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do\\r\\nnot think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her\\r\\nbehaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.\\r\\nI do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate\\r\\nwith me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I\\r\\nam sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline did not return my\\r\\nvisit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the\\r\\nmeantime.  When she did come, it was very evident that she had\\r\\nno pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\r\\ncalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and\\r\\nwas in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went\\r\\naway I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no\\r\\nlonger.  I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.  She was very\\r\\nwrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every\\r\\nadvance to intimacy began on her side.  But I pity her, because\\r\\nshe must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\\r\\nvery sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.  I need\\r\\nnot explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety to\\r\\nbe quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her\\r\\nbehaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister,\\r\\nwhatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\\r\\namiable.  I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such\\r\\nfears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must\\r\\nhave met, long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am\\r\\ncertain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem,\\r\\nby her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself\\r\\nthat he is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot understand it.  If\\r\\nI were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted\\r\\nto say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.\\r\\nBut I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think\\r\\nonly of what will make me happy-- your affection, and the\\r\\ninvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear from\\r\\nyou very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\\r\\nwith any certainty.  We had better not mention it.  I am\\r\\nextremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our\\r\\nfriends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\\r\\nMaria.  I am sure you will be very comfortable there.-- Yours,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\\r\\nshe considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister\\r\\nat least.  All expectation from the brother was now absolutely\\r\\nover.  She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\r\\nHis character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for\\r\\nhim, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped\\r\\nhe might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\\'s sister, as by Wickham\\'s\\r\\naccount, she would make him abundantly regret what he had\\r\\nthrown away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\r\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and\\r\\nElizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to\\r\\nher aunt than to herself.  His apparent partiality had subsided, his\\r\\nattentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\r\\nElizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it\\r\\nand write of it without material pain.  Her heart had been but\\r\\nslightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that\\r\\nSHE would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.\\r\\nThe sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the\\r\\nmost remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now\\r\\nrendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted\\r\\nperhaps in this case than in Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him\\r\\nfor his wish of independence.  Nothing, on the contrary, could\\r\\nbe more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few\\r\\nstruggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and\\r\\ndesirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating\\r\\nthe circumstances, she thus went on:-- \"I am now convinced, my\\r\\ndear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really\\r\\nexperiences that pure and elevating passion, I should at present\\r\\ndetest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.  But my\\r\\nfeelings are not only cordial towards HIM; they are even\\r\\nimpartial towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I hate her at\\r\\nall, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good\\r\\nsort of girl.  There can be no love in all this.  My watchfulness\\r\\nhas been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\r\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in\\r\\nlove with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative\\r\\ninsignificance.  Importance may sometimes be purchased too\\r\\ndearly.  Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart\\r\\nthan I do.  They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet\\r\\nopen to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men\\r\\nmust have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 27\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and\\r\\notherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,\\r\\nsometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February\\r\\npass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.  She had\\r\\nnot at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte,\\r\\nshe soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually\\r\\nlearned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as\\r\\ngreater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire of seeing\\r\\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.  There\\r\\nwas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\r\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little\\r\\nchange was not unwelcome for its own sake.  The journey\\r\\nwould moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the\\r\\ntime drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.\\r\\nEverything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled\\r\\naccording to Charlotte\\'s first sketch.  She was to accompany Sir\\r\\nWilliam and his second daughter.  The improvement of spending\\r\\na night in London was added in time, and the plan became\\r\\nperfect as plan could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly\\r\\nmiss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her\\r\\ngoing, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to\\r\\nanswer her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\\r\\nfriendly; on his side even more.  His present pursuit could not\\r\\nmake him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to\\r\\ndeserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be\\r\\nadmired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her\\r\\nevery enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--\\r\\ntheir opinion of everybody-- would always coincide, there was a\\r\\nsolicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him\\r\\nwith a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced\\r\\nthat, whether married or single, he must always be her model of\\r\\nthe amiable and pleasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\r\\nthink him less agreeable.  Sir William Lucas, and his daughter\\r\\nMaria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself,\\r\\nhad nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were\\r\\nlistened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.\\r\\nElizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\'s too\\r\\nlong.  He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his\\r\\npresentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out,\\r\\nlike his information.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\\r\\nearly as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.  As they drove to\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window\\r\\nwatching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was\\r\\nthere to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her\\r\\nface, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.  On the\\r\\nstairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for\\r\\ntheir cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for\\r\\na twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All was joy and\\r\\nkindness.  The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in\\r\\nbustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.  Their first object was\\r\\nher sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in\\r\\nreply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled\\r\\nto support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.  It was\\r\\nreasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s\\r\\nvisit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations\\r\\noccurring at different times between Jane and herself, which\\r\\nproved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on  Wickham\\'s desertion,\\r\\nand complimented her on bearing it so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss\\r\\nKing?  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\\r\\naffairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?  Where\\r\\ndoes discretion end, and avarice begin?  Last Christmas you\\r\\nwere afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent;\\r\\nand now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten\\r\\nthousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall\\r\\nknow what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.  I know no harm of\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\\'s\\r\\ndeath made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- what should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain\\r\\nMY affections because I had no money, what occasion could\\r\\nthere be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about,\\r\\nand who was equally poor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\\r\\ntowards her so soon after this event.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those\\r\\nelegant decorums which other people may observe.  If SHE does\\r\\nnot object to it, why should WE?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HER not objecting does not justify HIM.  It only shows her\\r\\nbeing deficient in something herself-- sense or feeling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose.  HE shall be\\r\\nmercenary, and SHE shall be foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose.  I should be sorry,\\r\\nyou know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in\\r\\nDerbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\\r\\nlive in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\\r\\nHertfordshire are not much better.  I am sick of them all.  Thank\\r\\nHeaven!  I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has\\r\\nnot one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to\\r\\nrecommend him.  Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing,\\r\\nafter all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\\r\\ndisappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she\\r\\nhad the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her\\r\\nuncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking\\r\\nin the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, \"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and\\r\\nher acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight!\\r\\nwhat felicity!  You give me fresh life and vigour.  Adieu to\\r\\ndisappointment and spleen.  What are young men to rocks and\\r\\nmountains?  Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend!  And\\r\\nwhen we DO return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\r\\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything.  We WILL\\r\\nknow where we have gone-- we WILL recollect what we have\\r\\nseen.  Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together\\r\\nin our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any\\r\\nparticular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative\\r\\nsituation.  Let OUR first effusions be less insupportable than\\r\\nthose of the generality of travellers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 28\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery object in the next day\\'s journey was new and interesting\\r\\nto Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she\\r\\nhad seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her\\r\\nhealth, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant\\r\\nsource of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\\r\\nwas in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to\\r\\nbring it in view.  The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary\\r\\non one side.  Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she\\r\\nhad heard of its inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible.  The garden sloping to\\r\\nthe road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel\\r\\nhedge, everything declared they were arriving.  Mr. Collins and\\r\\nCharlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the\\r\\nsmall gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst\\r\\nthe nods and smiles of the whole party.  In a moment they were\\r\\nall out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.  Mrs.\\r\\nCollins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and\\r\\nElizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she\\r\\nfound herself so affectionately received.  She saw instantly that\\r\\nher cousin\\'s manner were not altered by his marriage; his formal\\r\\ncivility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\r\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all\\r\\nher family.  They were then, with no other delay than his\\r\\npointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house;\\r\\nand as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a\\r\\nsecond time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode,\\r\\nand punctually repeated all his wife\\'s offers of refreshment.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\\r\\nhelp in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the\\r\\nroom, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself\\r\\nparticularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had\\r\\nlost in refusing him.  But though everything seemed neat and\\r\\ncomfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of\\r\\nrepentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she\\r\\ncould have so cheerful an air with such a companion.  When\\r\\nMr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\r\\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily\\r\\nturned her eye on Charlotte.  Once of twice she could discern a\\r\\nfaint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.  After\\r\\nsitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the\\r\\nroom, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of\\r\\ntheir journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\r\\nCollins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was\\r\\nlarge and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he\\r\\nattended himself.  To work in this garden was one of his most\\r\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\\r\\ncountenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of\\r\\nthe exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\r\\nHere, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and\\r\\nscarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked\\r\\nfor, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\\r\\nbeauty entirely behind.  He could number the fields in every\\r\\ndirection, and could tell how many tress there were in the most\\r\\ndistant clump.  But of all the views which his garden, or which\\r\\nthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared\\r\\nwith the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees\\r\\nthat bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.  It\\r\\nwas a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\\r\\nmeadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the\\r\\nremains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William\\r\\naccompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\\r\\nhouse, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\\r\\nof showing it without her husband\\'s help.  It was rather small,\\r\\nbut well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and\\r\\narranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth\\r\\ngave Charlotte all the credit.  When Mr. Collins could be\\r\\nforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout,\\r\\nand by Charlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed\\r\\nhe must be often forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the\\r\\ncountry.  It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when\\r\\nMr. Collins joining in, observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I\\r\\nneed not say you will be delighted with her.  She is all affability\\r\\nand condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured\\r\\nwith some portion of her notice when service is over.  I have\\r\\nscarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my\\r\\nsister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during\\r\\nyour stay here.  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.\\r\\nWe dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\\r\\nwalk home.  Her ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us.\\r\\nI SHOULD say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has\\r\\nseveral.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\\r\\nadded Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.  She is the sort of\\r\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was  spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire\\r\\nnews, and telling again what had already been written; and when\\r\\nit closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to\\r\\nmeditate upon Charlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand\\r\\nher address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her\\r\\nhusband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.  She\\r\\nhad also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor\\r\\nof their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.  A\\r\\nlively imagination soon settled it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\\r\\nready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the\\r\\nwhole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she\\r\\nheard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling\\r\\nloudly after her.  She opened the door and met Maria in the\\r\\nlanding place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\\r\\ndining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!  I will not tell\\r\\nyou what it is.  Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\\r\\nmore, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted\\r\\nthe lane, in quest of this wonder!  It was two ladies stopping in a\\r\\nlow phaeton at the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I expected at least that the\\r\\npigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady\\r\\nCatherine and her daughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is\\r\\nnot Lady Catherine.  The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives\\r\\nwith them; the other is Miss de Bourgh.  Only look at her.  She\\r\\nis quite a little creature.  Who would have thought that she could\\r\\nbe so thin and small?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this\\r\\nwind.  Why does she not come in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.  It is the greatest of\\r\\nfavours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\r\\n\"She looks sickly and cross.  Yes, she will do for him very well.\\r\\nShe will make him a very proper wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\\r\\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high\\r\\ndiversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest\\r\\ncontemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly\\r\\nbowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\\r\\nand the others returned into the house.  Mr. Collins no sooner\\r\\nsaw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their\\r\\ngood fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know\\r\\nthat the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 29\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\\r\\ncomplete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\\r\\nto his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\\r\\ntowards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished\\r\\nfor; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon,\\r\\nwas such an instance of Lady Catherine\\'s condescension, as he\\r\\nknew not how to admire enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised\\r\\nby her ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the\\r\\nevening at Rosings.  I rather expected, from my knowledge of\\r\\nher affability, that it would happen.  But who could have\\r\\nforeseen such an attention as this?  Who could have imagined\\r\\nthat we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation,\\r\\nmoreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your\\r\\narrival!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir\\r\\nWilliam, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great\\r\\nreally are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\r\\nAbout the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\\r\\nuncommon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning\\r\\nbut their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\\r\\nthem in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\\r\\nso many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\\r\\noverpower them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette. Her said to\\r\\nElizabeth--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your\\r\\napparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of\\r\\ndress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.  I would\\r\\nadvise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior\\r\\nto the rest-- there is no occasion for anything more.  Lady\\r\\nCatherine will not think the worse of you for being simply\\r\\ndressed.  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\\r\\ndifferent doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\r\\nSuch formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\\r\\nliving, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\\r\\ncompany, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\\r\\nwith as much apprehension as her father had done to his\\r\\npresentation at St. James\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\r\\nmile across the park.  Every park has its beauty and its\\r\\nprospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though\\r\\nshe could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the\\r\\nscene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration\\r\\nof the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\\r\\nglazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was\\r\\nevery moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look\\r\\nperfectly calm.  Elizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her.  She had\\r\\nheard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any\\r\\nextraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere\\r\\nstateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness\\r\\nwithout trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\r\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\\r\\nthey followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\\r\\nwhere Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\\r\\nsitting.  Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\\r\\nthem; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the\\r\\noffice of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\\r\\nproper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which\\r\\nhe would have thought necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of having been at St. James\\'s Sir William was so\\r\\ncompletely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had\\r\\nbut just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his\\r\\nseat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost\\r\\nout of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing\\r\\nwhich way to look.  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the\\r\\nscene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.\\r\\nLady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\r\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome.  Her air was\\r\\nnot conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as\\r\\nto make her visitors forget their inferior rank.  She was not\\r\\nrendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was\\r\\nspoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance,\\r\\nand brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and\\r\\nfrom the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady\\r\\nCatherine to be exactly what he represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\\r\\ndeportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nshe turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have\\r\\njoined in Maria\\'s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.\\r\\nThere was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the\\r\\nladies.  Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though\\r\\nnot plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in\\r\\na low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was\\r\\nnothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to\\r\\nwhat she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\r\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\\r\\nwindows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to\\r\\npoint out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them\\r\\nthat it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\\r\\nservants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\\r\\npromised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\\r\\nthe bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if\\r\\nhe felt that life could furnish nothing greater.  He carved, and\\r\\nate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\\r\\ncommended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\\r\\nenough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\r\\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\r\\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive\\r\\nadmiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any\\r\\ndish on the table proved a novelty to them.  The party did not\\r\\nsupply much conversation.  Elizabeth was ready to speak\\r\\nwhenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\\r\\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh-- the former of whom was\\r\\nengaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a\\r\\nword to her all dinner-time.  Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly\\r\\nemployed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing\\r\\nher to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.\\r\\nMaria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen\\r\\ndid nothing but eat and admire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little\\r\\nto be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did\\r\\nwithout any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her\\r\\nopinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that\\r\\nshe was not used to have her judgement controverted.  She\\r\\ninquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic concerns familiarly and\\r\\nminutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management\\r\\nof them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so\\r\\nsmall a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her\\r\\ncows and her poultry.  Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath\\r\\nthis great lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an\\r\\noccasion of dictating to others.  In the intervals of her discourse\\r\\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria\\r\\nand Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections\\r\\nshe knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a\\r\\nvery genteel, pretty kind of girl.  She asked her, at different\\r\\ntimes, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or\\r\\nyounger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be\\r\\nmarried, whether they were handsome, where they had been\\r\\neducated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\\r\\nmother\\'s maiden name?  Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\\r\\nquestions but answered them very composedly.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nthen observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.  For\\r\\nyour sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I\\r\\nsee no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.  It was\\r\\nnot thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family.  Do you\\r\\nplay and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! then-- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.\\r\\nOur instrument is a capital one, probably superior to---- You\\r\\nshall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of them does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did not you all learn?  You ought all to have learned.  The\\r\\nMiss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\\r\\nas yours.  Do you draw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very strange.  But I suppose you had no opportunity.\\r\\nYour mother should have taken you to town every spring for the\\r\\nbenefit of masters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\\r\\nLondon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No governess!  How was that possible? Five daughters brought\\r\\nup at home without a governess!  I never heard of such a thing.\\r\\nYour mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\\r\\nnot been the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, who taught you?  who attended to you?  Without a\\r\\ngoverness, you must have been neglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\\r\\nas wished to learn never wanted the means.  We were always\\r\\nencouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\r\\nThose who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if\\r\\nI had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\r\\nstrenuously to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be\\r\\ndone in education without steady and regular instruction, and\\r\\nnobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many\\r\\nfamilies I have been the means of supplying in that way.  I am\\r\\nalways glad to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces\\r\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my\\r\\nmeans; and it was but the other day that I recommended another\\r\\nyoung person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me,\\r\\nand the family are quite delighted with her.  Mrs. Collins, did I\\r\\ntell you of Lady Metcalf\\'s calling yesterday to thank me?  She\\r\\nfinds Miss Pope a treasure.  \\'Lady Catherine,\\' said she, \\'you\\r\\nhave given me a treasure.\\'  Are any of your younger sisters out,\\r\\nMiss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All!  What, all five out at once?  Very odd!  And you only the\\r\\nsecond.  The younger ones out before the elder ones are\\r\\nmarried!  Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps SHE is full young to\\r\\nbe much in company.  But really, ma\\'am, I think it would be\\r\\nvery hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their\\r\\nshare of society and amusement, because the elder may not have\\r\\nthe means or inclination to marry early.  The last-born has as\\r\\ngood a right to the pleasures of youth at the first.  And to be\\r\\nkept back on SUCH a motive!  I think it would not be very likely\\r\\nto promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very\\r\\ndecidedly for so young a person.  Pray, what is your age?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nsmiling, \"your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\\r\\nanswer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\\r\\nwho had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified\\r\\nimpertinence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\\r\\nnot conceal your age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\\r\\ncard-tables were placed.  Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nchose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of\\r\\nassisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.  Their table was\\r\\nsuperlatively stupid.  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not\\r\\nrelate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\\r\\nfears of Miss de Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or having\\r\\ntoo much or too little light.  A great deal more passed at the\\r\\nother table.  Lady Catherine was generally speaking-- stating the\\r\\nmistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\\r\\nherself.  Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her\\r\\nladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\\r\\napologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir William did not\\r\\nsay much.  He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\\r\\nnames.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as\\r\\nthey chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.\\r\\nThe party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\\r\\ndetermine what weather they were to have on the morrow.\\r\\nFrom these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of\\r\\nthe coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s side and as many bows on Sir William\\'s they departed.\\r\\nAs soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called\\r\\non by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at\\r\\nRosings, which, for Charlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable\\r\\nthan it really was.  But her commendation, though costing her\\r\\nsome trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was\\r\\nvery soon obliged to take her ladyship\\'s praise into his own\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 30\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was\\r\\nlong enough to convince him of his daughter\\'s being most\\r\\ncomfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\\r\\nsuch a neighbour as were not often met with.  While Sir William\\r\\nwas with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him\\r\\nout in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went\\r\\naway, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\\r\\nElizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\r\\ncousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between\\r\\nbreakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in\\r\\nthe garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the\\r\\nwindow in his own book-room, which fronted the road.  The\\r\\nroom in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at\\r\\nfirst rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the\\r\\ndining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and\\r\\nhad a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had\\r\\nan excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would\\r\\nundoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they\\r\\nsat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the\\r\\narrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the\\r\\nlane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of\\r\\nwhat carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de\\r\\nBourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming\\r\\nto inform them of, though it happened almost every day.  She\\r\\nnot unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\r\\nprevailed upon to get out.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\\r\\nRosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\\r\\nnecessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there\\r\\nmight be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not\\r\\nunderstand the sacrifice of so many hours.  Now and then they\\r\\nwere honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing\\r\\nescaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\r\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at\\r\\ntheir work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault\\r\\nwith the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid\\r\\nin negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do\\r\\nit only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\\'s joints of\\r\\n\\r\\neat were too large for her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\r\\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active\\r\\nmagistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which\\r\\nwere carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the\\r\\ncottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too\\r\\npoor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,\\r\\nsilence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and\\r\\nplenty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice\\r\\na week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being\\r\\nonly one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was\\r\\nthe counterpart of the first.  Their other engagements were few,\\r\\nas the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s reach.  This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth,\\r\\nand upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough;\\r\\nthere were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte,\\r\\nand the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\\r\\noften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and\\r\\nwhere she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady\\r\\nCatherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of\\r\\nthe park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one\\r\\nseemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed\\r\\naway.  Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was\\r\\nto bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a\\r\\ncircle must be important.  Elizabeth had heard soon after her\\r\\narrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few\\r\\nweeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances\\r\\nwhom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one\\r\\ncomparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she\\r\\nmight be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs\\r\\non him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was\\r\\nevidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming\\r\\nwith the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the\\r\\nhighest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had\\r\\nalready been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas walking the whole morning within view of the lodges\\r\\nopening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest\\r\\n\\r\\nassurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned\\r\\ninto the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.  On the\\r\\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.\\r\\nThere were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\\r\\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the\\r\\nyounger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of\\r\\nall the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman\\r\\naccompanied him.  Charlotte had seen them from her husband\\'s\\r\\nroom, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other,\\r\\ntold the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nwould never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the\\r\\ncompliment, before their approach was announced by the\\r\\ndoor-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered\\r\\nthe room.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about\\r\\nthirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the\\r\\ngentleman . Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look\\r\\nin Hertfordshire-- paid his compliments, with his usual reserve,\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\r\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth\\r\\nmerely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\r\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very\\r\\npleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight\\r\\nobservation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for\\r\\nsome time without speaking to anybody.  At length, however,\\r\\nhis civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after\\r\\nthe health of her family.  She answered him in the usual way,\\r\\nand after a moment\\'s pause, added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.  Have\\r\\nyou never happened to see her there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\\r\\nsee whether he would betray any consciousness of what had\\r\\npassed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he\\r\\nlooked a little confused as he answered that he had never been\\r\\nso fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.  The subject was pursued\\r\\nno farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 31\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners were very much admired at the\\r\\nParsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably\\r\\nto the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.  It was some\\r\\ndays, however, before they received any invitation thither-- for\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile there were visitors in the house, they could not be\\r\\nnecessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the\\r\\ngentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an\\r\\nattention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\r\\ncome there in the evening.  For the last week they had seen very\\r\\nlittle of Lady Catherine or her daughter.  Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\ncalled at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\r\\nDarcy they had seen only at church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\\r\\njoined the party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room.  Her ladyship\\r\\nreceived them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by\\r\\nno means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and\\r\\nshe was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to\\r\\nthem, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person\\r\\nin the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything\\r\\nwas a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\'s\\r\\npretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.  He now\\r\\nseated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and\\r\\nHertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books\\r\\nand music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained\\r\\nin that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and\\r\\nflow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well\\r\\nas of Mr. Darcy.  HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\r\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,\\r\\nafter a while, shared the feeling, was more openly\\r\\nacknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is it you are\\r\\ntalking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?  Let me hear\\r\\nwhat it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer\\r\\nable to avoid a reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of music!  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all subjects my\\r\\n\\r\\ndelight.  I must have my share in the conversation if you are\\r\\nspeaking of music.  There are few people in England, I suppose,\\r\\nwho have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better\\r\\nnatural taste.  If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great\\r\\nproficient.  And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to\\r\\napply.  I am confident that she would have performed\\r\\ndelightfully.  How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s\\r\\nproficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\\r\\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to\\r\\nexcel if she does not practice a good deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such\\r\\nadvice.  She practises very constantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  It cannot be done too much; and when I\\r\\nnext write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\\r\\naccount.  I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is\\r\\nto be acquired without constant practice.  I have told Miss\\r\\nBennet several times, that she will never play really well unless\\r\\nshe practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument,\\r\\nshe is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to\\r\\nRosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\r\\nJenkinson\\'s room.  She would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in\\r\\nthat part of the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill-breeding, and\\r\\nmade no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth\\r\\nof having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to\\r\\nthe instrument.  He drew a chair near her.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nlistened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other\\r\\nnephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with\\r\\nhis usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so\\r\\nas to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s countenance.\\r\\nElizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient\\r\\npause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state\\r\\nto hear me?  I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play\\r\\nso well.  There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to\\r\\n\\r\\nbe frightened at the will of others.  My courage always rises at\\r\\nevery attempt to intimidate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you\\r\\ncould not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming\\r\\nyou; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long\\r\\nenough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally\\r\\nprofessing opinions which in fact are not your own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty\\r\\nnotion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.  I am\\r\\nparticularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose\\r\\nmy real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to\\r\\npass myself off with some degree of credit.  Indeed, Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nit is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my\\r\\ndisadvantage in Hertfordshire-- and, give me leave to say, very\\r\\nimpolitic too-- for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things\\r\\nmay come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam.  \"I should like to know how he behaves\\r\\namong strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall hear then-- but prepare yourself for something very\\r\\ndreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nyou must know, was at a ball-- and at this ball, what do you\\r\\nthink he did?  He danced only four dances, though gentlemen\\r\\nwere scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one\\r\\nyoung lady was sitting down in want of a partner.  Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nyou cannot deny the fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the\\r\\nassembly beyond my own party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.  Well,\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?  My fingers wait your\\r\\norders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I\\r\\nsought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend\\r\\nmyself to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\nstill addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.  \"Shall we ask him why a\\r\\nman of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill\\r\\nqualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without\\r\\napplying to him.  It is because he will not give himself the\\r\\ntrouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in\\r\\ntheir concerns, as I often see done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument\\r\\nin the masterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do.  They\\r\\nhave not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the\\r\\nsame expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my\\r\\nown fault-- because I will not take the trouble of practising.  It is\\r\\nnot that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other\\r\\nwoman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right.  You have\\r\\nemployed your time much better.  No one admitted to the\\r\\nprivilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.  We neither\\r\\nof us perform to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\\r\\nknow what they were talking of.  Elizabeth immediately began\\r\\nplaying again.  Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening\\r\\nfor a few minutes, said to Darcy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,\\r\\nand could have the advantage of a London master.  She has a\\r\\nvery good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to\\r\\nAnne\\'s.  Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her\\r\\nhealth allowed her to learn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other\\r\\ncould she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of\\r\\nhis behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for\\r\\nMiss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry\\r\\nHER, had she been his relation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nperformance, mixing with them many instructions on execution\\r\\nand taste.  Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of\\r\\ncivility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the\\r\\ninstrument till her ladyship\\'s carriage was ready to take them all\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 32\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\\r\\nJane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into\\r\\nthe village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the\\r\\ncertain signal of a visitor.  As she had heard no carriage, she\\r\\nthought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that\\r\\napprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she\\r\\nmight escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened,\\r\\nand, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,\\r\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised\\r\\nfor his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all\\r\\nthe ladies were to be within.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were\\r\\nmade, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.  It was\\r\\nabsolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this\\r\\nemergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him last in\\r\\nHertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say\\r\\non the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.\\r\\nBingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right,\\r\\nhe went but the day before.  He and his sisters were well, I hope,\\r\\nwhen you left London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a\\r\\nshort pause added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\\r\\never returning to Netherfield again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may\\r\\nspend very little of his time there in the future.  He has many\\r\\nfriends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are\\r\\ncontinually increasing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\\r\\nthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for\\r\\nthen we might possibly get a settled family there.  But, perhaps,\\r\\nMr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience\\r\\nof the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to\\r\\nkeep it or quit it on the same principle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up\\r\\nas soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer.  She was afraid of talking longer of\\r\\nhis friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined\\r\\nto leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very\\r\\ncomfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to\\r\\nit when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe she did-- and I am sure she could not have bestowed\\r\\nher kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\\r\\nwife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\\r\\none of the very few sensible women who would have accepted\\r\\nhim, or have made him happy if they had.  My friend has an\\r\\nexcellent understanding-- though I am not certain that I consider\\r\\nher marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.  She\\r\\nseems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is\\r\\ncertainly a very good match for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\r\\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An easy distance, do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a\\r\\nday\\'s journey.  Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI should never have considered the distance as one of the\\r\\nADVANTAGES of the match,\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I should never\\r\\nhave said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\\r\\nAnything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I\\r\\nsuppose, would appear far.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied\\r\\nshe understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane\\r\\nand Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\\r\\nher family.  The far and the near must be relative, and depend on\\r\\nmany varying circumstances.  Where there is fortune to make the\\r\\nexpenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.\\r\\nBut that is not the case HERE.  Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a\\r\\ncomfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent\\r\\njourneys-- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself\\r\\nNEAR her family under less than HALF the present distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"YOU\\r\\ncannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.  YOU\\r\\ncannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked surprised.  The gentleman experienced some\\r\\nchange of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper\\r\\nfrom the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the county ensued, on either\\r\\nside calm and concise-- and soon put an end to by the entrance\\r\\nof Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk.  The\\r\\ntete-a-tete surprised them.  Mr. Darcy related the mistake which\\r\\nhad occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a\\r\\nfew minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone.  \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he\\r\\nwould never have called us in this familiar way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very\\r\\nlikely, even to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after\\r\\nvarious conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to\\r\\n\\r\\nproceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was\\r\\nthe more probable from the time of year.  All field sports were\\r\\nover.  Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a\\r\\nbilliard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and\\r\\nin the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk\\r\\nto it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\\r\\ntemptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\r\\nThey called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\r\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied\\r\\nby their aunt.  It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\ncame because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion\\r\\nwhich of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nreminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by\\r\\nhis evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George\\r\\nWickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was\\r\\nless captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners, she\\r\\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\\r\\ndifficult to understand.  It could not be for society, as he\\r\\nfrequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his\\r\\nlips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity\\r\\nrather than of choice-- a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure  to\\r\\nhimself.  He seldom appeared really animated.  Mrs. Collins\\r\\nknew not what to make of him.  Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s\\r\\noccasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\\r\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not\\r\\nhave told her; and as she would liked to have believed this\\r\\nchange the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend\\r\\nEliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.  She\\r\\nwatched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he\\r\\ncame to Hunsford; but without much success.  He certainly\\r\\nlooked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look\\r\\nwas disputable.  It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\r\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and\\r\\nsometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of\\r\\nhis being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from\\r\\nthe danger of raising expectations which might only end in\\r\\ndisappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt,\\r\\nthat all her friend\\'s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose\\r\\nhim to be in her power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her\\r\\nmarrying colonel Fitzwilliam.  He was beyond comparison the\\r\\nmost pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in\\r\\nlife was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages,\\r\\nMr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his\\r\\ncousin could have none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 33\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\r\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.  She felt all the perverseness of\\r\\nthe mischance that should bring him where no one else was\\r\\nbrought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to\\r\\ninform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.  How it\\r\\ncould occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!  Yet it did,\\r\\nand even a third.  It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary\\r\\npenance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal\\r\\ninquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually\\r\\nthought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.  He never\\r\\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\r\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\r\\nrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--\\r\\nabout her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary\\r\\nwalks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\'s happiness; and\\r\\nthat in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding\\r\\nthe house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into\\r\\nKent again she would be staying THERE too.  His words\\r\\nseemed to imply it.  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his\\r\\nthoughts?  She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean\\r\\nand allusion to what might arise in that quarter.  It distressed\\r\\nher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in\\r\\nthe pales opposite the Parsonage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked in perusing Jane\\'s last\\r\\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane\\r\\nhad not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised\\r\\nby Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\nwas meeting her.  Putting away the letter immediately and\\r\\nforcing a smile, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I\\r\\n\\r\\ngenerally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the\\r\\nParsonage.  Are you going much farther?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\\r\\nParsonage together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- if Darcy does not put it off again.  But I am at his\\r\\ndisposal.  He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\\r\\nleast pleasure in the great power of choice.  I do not know\\r\\nanybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he\\r\\nlikes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam.  \"But so we all do.  It is only that he has better\\r\\nmeans of having it than many others, because he is rich, and\\r\\nmany others are poor.  I speak feelingly.  A younger son, you\\r\\nknow, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little\\r\\nof either.  Now seriously, what have you ever known of\\r\\nself-denial and dependence?  When have you been prevented by\\r\\nwant of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring\\r\\nanything you had a fancy for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are home questions-- and perhaps I cannot say that I\\r\\nhave experienced many hardships of that nature.  But in matters\\r\\nof greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.  Younger\\r\\nsons cannot marry where they like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they\\r\\nvery often do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too\\r\\nmany in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some\\r\\nattention to money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured\\r\\nat the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And\\r\\npray, what is the usual price of an earl\\'s younger son?  Unless\\r\\n\\r\\nthe elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask\\r\\nabove fifty thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.  To\\r\\ninterrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with\\r\\nwhat had passed, she soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for\\r\\nthe sake of  having someone at his disposal.  I wonder he does\\r\\nnot marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.  But,\\r\\nperhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is\\r\\nunder his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he\\r\\nmust divide with me.  I am joined with him in the guardianship\\r\\nof Miss Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians do you\\r\\nmake?  Does your charge give you much trouble?  Young ladies\\r\\nof her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she\\r\\nhas the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\\r\\nmanner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed\\r\\nMiss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her\\r\\nthat she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.  She\\r\\ndirectly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm of her; and\\r\\nI dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\r\\nShe is a very great favourite with some ladies of my\\r\\nacquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.  I think I have heard\\r\\nyou say that you know them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know them a little.  Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\\r\\nman-- he is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Care of him!  Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care of\\r\\nhim in those points where he most wants care.  From something\\r\\nthat he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think\\r\\nBingley very much indebted to him.  But I ought to beg his\\r\\npardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the\\r\\n\\r\\nperson meant.  It was all conjecture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\\r\\nknown, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it\\r\\nwould be an unpleasant thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to\\r\\nbe Bingley.  What he told me was merely this: that he\\r\\ncongratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the\\r\\ninconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without\\r\\nmentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected\\r\\nit to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get\\r\\ninto a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been\\r\\ntogether the whole of last summer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections\\r\\nagainst the lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling.\\r\\n\"He only told me what I have now told you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling\\r\\nwith indignation.  After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked\\r\\nher why she was so thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Your cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings.  Why was he\\r\\nto be the judge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the\\r\\npropriety of his friend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own\\r\\njudgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner\\r\\nhis friend was to be happy.  But,\" she continued, recollecting\\r\\nherself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to\\r\\ncondemn him.  It is not to be supposed that there was much\\r\\n\\r\\naffection in the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\\r\\nlessening of the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer,\\r\\nand therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on\\r\\nindifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.  There, shut\\r\\ninto her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could\\r\\nthink without interruption of all that she had heard.  It was not\\r\\nto be supposed that any other people could be meant than those\\r\\nwith whom she was connected.  There could not exist in the\\r\\nworld TWO men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such\\r\\nboundless influence.  That he had been concerned in the\\r\\nmeasures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never\\r\\ndoubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the\\r\\nprincipal design and arrangement of them.  If his own vanity,\\r\\nhowever,  did not mislead him, HE was the cause, his pride and\\r\\ncaprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still\\r\\ncontinued to suffer.  He had ruined for a while every hope of\\r\\nhappiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world;\\r\\nand no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s words; and those strong objections\\r\\nprobably were, her having one uncle who was a country\\r\\nattorney, and another who was in business in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility\\r\\nof objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!-- her\\r\\nunderstanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners\\r\\ncaptivating.  Neither could anything be urged against my father,\\r\\nwho, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself need not disdain, and respectability which he will\\r\\nprobably never each.\"  When she thought of her mother, her\\r\\nconfidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any\\r\\nobjections THERE had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\r\\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\\r\\nthe want of importance in his friend\\'s connections, than from\\r\\ntheir want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he\\r\\nhad been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly\\r\\nby the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on\\r\\na headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening,\\r\\nthat, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined\\r\\nher not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were\\r\\nengaged to drink tea.  Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really\\r\\nunwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible\\r\\nprevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could\\r\\nnot conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather\\r\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 34\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate\\r\\nherself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her\\r\\nemployment the examination of all the letters which Jane had\\r\\nwritten to her since her being in Kent.  They contained no actual\\r\\ncomplaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any\\r\\ncommunication of present suffering.  But in all, and in almost\\r\\nevery line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which\\r\\nhad been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding\\r\\nfrom the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\r\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\r\\nElizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of\\r\\nuneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the\\r\\nfirst perusal.  Mr. Darcy\\'s shameful boast of what misery he had\\r\\nbeen able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister\\'s\\r\\nsufferings.  It was some consolation to think that his visit to\\r\\nRosings was to end on the day after the next-- and, a still\\r\\ngreater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with\\r\\nJane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\r\\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent without\\r\\nremembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and\\r\\nagreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound\\r\\nof the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea\\r\\nof its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before\\r\\ncalled late in the evening, and might now come to inquire\\r\\nparticularly after her.  But this idea was soon banished, and her\\r\\n\\r\\nspirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter\\r\\namazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.  In an\\r\\nhurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health,\\r\\nimputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.  She\\r\\nanswered him with cold civility.  He sat down for a few\\r\\nmoments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.  After a silence of\\r\\nseveral minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and\\r\\nthus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In vain I have struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings will not be\\r\\nrepressed.  You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire\\r\\nand love you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression.  She stared,\\r\\ncoloured, doubted, and was silent.  This he considered sufficient\\r\\nencouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long\\r\\nfelt for her, immediately followed.  He spoke well; but there\\r\\nwere feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he\\r\\nwas not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of\\r\\npride.  His sense of her inferiority-- of its being a degradation--\\r\\nof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination,\\r\\nwere dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\\r\\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\\r\\nrecommend his suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible\\r\\nto the compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her\\r\\nintentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for\\r\\nthe pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his\\r\\nsubsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.  She\\r\\ntried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience,\\r\\nwhen he should have done.  He concluded with representing to\\r\\nher the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his\\r\\nendeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\r\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her\\r\\nacceptance of his hand.  As he said this, she could easily see that\\r\\nhe had no doubt of a favourable answer.  He SPOKE of\\r\\napprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\\r\\nsecurity.  Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther,\\r\\nand, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\r\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever unequally they may be returned.  It is natural that\\r\\nobligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I would\\r\\nnow thank you.  But I cannot-- I have never desired your good\\r\\nopinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.  I\\r\\n\\r\\nam sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.  It has been most\\r\\nunconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short\\r\\nduration.  The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\\r\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\\r\\novercoming it after this explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his\\r\\neyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less\\r\\nresentment than surprise.  His complexion became pale with\\r\\nanger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every\\r\\nfeature.  He was struggling for the appearance of composure,\\r\\nand would not open his lips till he believed himself to have\\r\\nattained it.  The pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings dreadful.  At\\r\\nlength, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is the reply which I am to have the honour of\\r\\nexpecting:  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\\r\\nlittle ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected.  But it is of\\r\\nsmall importance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \" why with so evident a\\r\\ndesire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that\\r\\nyou liked me against your will, against your reason, and even\\r\\nagainst your character?  Was not this some excuse for incivility,\\r\\nif I WAS uncivil?  But I have other provocations.  You know I\\r\\nhave.  Had not my feelings decided against you-- had they been\\r\\nindifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\\r\\nany consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\r\\nbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a\\r\\nmost beloved sister?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but\\r\\nthe emotion was short, and he listened without attempting\\r\\nto interrupt her while she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.  No motive\\r\\ncan excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted THERE.\\r\\nYou dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal,\\r\\nif not the only means of dividing them from each other-- of\\r\\nexposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and\\r\\n\\r\\ninstability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes,\\r\\nand involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\\r\\nlistening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any\\r\\nfeeling of remorse.  He even looked at her with a smile of\\r\\naffected incredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of\\r\\ndenying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend\\r\\nfrom your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.  Towards HIM I\\r\\nhave been kinder than towards myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil\\r\\nreflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\\r\\nconciliate her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my\\r\\ndislike is founded.  Long before it had taken place my opinion of\\r\\nyou was decided.  Your character was unfolded in the recital\\r\\nwhich I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.  On this\\r\\nsubject, what can you have to say?  In what imaginary act of\\r\\nfriendship can you here defend yourself?  or under what\\r\\nmisrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help\\r\\nfeeling an interest in him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his\\r\\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy.  \"You\\r\\nhave reduced him to his present state of poverty-- comparative\\r\\npoverty.  You have withheld the advantages which you must\\r\\nknow to have been designed for him.  You have deprived the\\r\\nbest years of his life of that independence which was no less his\\r\\ndue than his desert.  You have done all this!  and yet you can\\r\\ntreat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room, \"Is your opinion of me!  This is the estimation in\\r\\nwhich you hold me!  I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My\\r\\nfaults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!  But\\r\\nperhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards\\r\\nher, \"these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your\\r\\npride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had\\r\\nlong prevented my forming any serious design.  These bitter\\r\\naccusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\r\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief\\r\\nof my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by\\r\\nreason, by reflection, by everything.  But disguise of every sort is\\r\\nmy abhorrence.  Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.\\r\\nThey were natural and just.  Could you expect me to rejoice in\\r\\nthe inferiority of your connections?-- to congratulate myself on\\r\\nthe hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly\\r\\nbeneath my own?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\\r\\ntried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of\\r\\nyour declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared\\r\\nthe concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you\\r\\nbehaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\\r\\nway that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with\\r\\nan expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.  She went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the very beginning-- from the first moment, I may almost\\r\\nsay-- of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me\\r\\nwith the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your\\r\\nselfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the\\r\\ngroundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have\\r\\nbuilt so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month\\r\\nbefore I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I\\r\\ncould ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly comprehend\\r\\nyour feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own\\r\\n\\r\\nhave been.  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your\\r\\ntime, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth\\r\\nheard him the next moment open the front door and quit the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.  She knew not\\r\\nhow to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and\\r\\ncried for half-an-hour.  Her astonishment, as she reflected on\\r\\nwhat had passed, was increased by every review of it.  That she\\r\\nshould receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!  That he\\r\\nshould have been in love with her for so many months!  So much\\r\\nin love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\\r\\nwhich had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying her sister, and\\r\\nwhich must appear at least with equal force in his own case--\\r\\nwas almost incredible!  It was gratifying to have inspired\\r\\nunconsciously so strong an affection.  But his pride, his\\r\\nabominable pride-- his shameless avowal of what he had done\\r\\nwith respect to Jane-- his unpardonable assurance in\\r\\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling\\r\\nmanner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty\\r\\ntowards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\\r\\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment\\r\\nexcited.  She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was\\r\\nto encounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to\\r\\nher room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 35\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and\\r\\nmeditations which had at length closed her eyes.  She could not\\r\\nyet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was\\r\\nimpossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for\\r\\nemployment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge\\r\\nherself in air and exercise.  She was proceeding directly to her\\r\\nfavourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\'s sometimes\\r\\ncoming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she\\r\\nturned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road.\\r\\nThe park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\\r\\npassed one of the gates into the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she\\r\\nwas tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the\\r\\ngates and look into the park.  The five weeks which she had now\\r\\npassed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and\\r\\nevery day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.  She was\\r\\non the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse\\r\\nof a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he\\r\\nwas moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was\\r\\ndirectly retreating.  But the person who advanced was now near\\r\\nenough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\r\\npronounced her name.  She had turned away; but on hearing\\r\\nherself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she moved again towards the gate.  He had by that time\\r\\nreached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively\\r\\ntook, said, with a look of haughty composure, \"I have been\\r\\nwalking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.  Will\\r\\nyou do me the honour of reading that letter?\"  And then, with a\\r\\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\r\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\\r\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper,\\r\\nwritten quite through, in a very close hand.  The envelope itself\\r\\nwas likewise full.  Pursuing her way along the lane, she then\\r\\nbegan it.  It was dated from Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning, and was as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\\r\\napprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments\\r\\nor renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to\\r\\nyou.  I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\\r\\nmyself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,\\r\\ncannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation\\r\\nand the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\\r\\nspared had not my character required it to be written and read.\\r\\nYou must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\r\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly,\\r\\nbut I demand it of your justice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of\\r\\nequal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.  The first\\r\\nmentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had\\r\\ndetached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had,\\r\\nin defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\\r\\n\\r\\nhumanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\\r\\nprospects of Mr. Wickham.  Wilfully and wantonly to have\\r\\nthrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\r\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\r\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought\\r\\nup to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the\\r\\nseparation of two young persons, whose affection could be the\\r\\ngrowth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.  But\\r\\nfrom the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\\r\\nbestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the\\r\\nfuture secured, when the following account of my actions and\\r\\ntheir motives has been read.  If, in the explanation of them,\\r\\nwhich is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating\\r\\nfeelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I\\r\\nam sorry.  The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology\\r\\nwould be absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\\r\\nwith others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other\\r\\nyoung woman in the country.  But it was not till the evening of\\r\\nthe dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his\\r\\nfeeling a serious attachment.  I had often seen him in love before.\\r\\nAt that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was\\r\\nfirst made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\'s accidental\\r\\ninformation, that Bingley\\'s attentions to your sister had given\\r\\nrise to a general expectation of their marriage.  He spoke of it as\\r\\na certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\r\\n>From that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour attentively;\\r\\nand I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\\r\\nbeyond what I had ever witnessed in him.  Your sister I also\\r\\nwatched.  Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and\\r\\nengaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard,\\r\\nand I remained convinced from the evening\\'s scrutiny, that\\r\\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not\\r\\ninvite them by any participation of sentiment.  If YOU have not\\r\\nbeen mistaken here, I must have been in error.  Your superior\\r\\nknowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.  If it be\\r\\nso, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your\\r\\nresentment has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not scruple to\\r\\nassert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and air was\\r\\nsuch as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\\r\\nthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\\r\\neasily touched.  That I was desirous of believing her indifferent\\r\\nis certain-- but I will venture to say that my investigation and\\r\\ndecisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.  I did\\r\\n\\r\\nnot believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it\\r\\non impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.  My\\r\\nobjections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\\r\\nnight acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put\\r\\naside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so\\r\\ngreat an evil to my friend as to me.  But there were other causes\\r\\nof repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing\\r\\nto an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured\\r\\nto forget, because they were not immediately before me.  These\\r\\ncauses must be stated, though briefly.  The situation of your\\r\\nmother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\r\\ncomparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so\\r\\nalmost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger\\r\\nsisters, and occasionally even by your father.  Pardon me.  It\\r\\npains me to offend you.  But amidst your concern for the defects\\r\\nof  your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\r\\nrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider\\r\\nthat, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\\r\\nthe like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and\\r\\nyour elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and\\r\\ndisposition of both.  I will only say farther that from what passed\\r\\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\\r\\ninducement heightened which could have led me before to\\r\\npreserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\r\\nconnection.  He left Netherfield for London, on the day\\r\\nfollowing, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of\\r\\nsoon returning.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained.  His sisters\\'\\r\\nuneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\\r\\ncoincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible\\r\\nthat no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\\r\\nresolved on joining him directly in London.  We accordingly\\r\\nwent-- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out\\r\\nto my friend the certain evils of such a choice.  I described, and\\r\\nenforced them earnestly.  But, however this remonstrance might\\r\\nhave staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\\r\\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not\\r\\nbeen seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of\\r\\nyour sister\\'s indifference.  He had before believed her to return\\r\\nhis affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.  But Bingley\\r\\nhas great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my\\r\\njudgement than on his own.  To convince him, therefore, that he\\r\\nhad deceived himself, was no very difficult point.  To persuade\\r\\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction\\r\\n\\r\\nhad been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.  I cannot\\r\\nblame myself for having done thus much.  There is but one part\\r\\nof my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with\\r\\nsatisfaction; it is, that I condescended to adopt the measures of\\r\\nart so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in town.  I\\r\\nknew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother\\r\\nis even yet ignorant of it.  That they might have met without ill\\r\\nconsequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear\\r\\nto me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\\r\\ndanger.  Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me;\\r\\nit is done, however, and it was done for the best.  On this subject\\r\\nI have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.  If I have\\r\\nwounded your sister\\'s feelings, it was unknowingly done and\\r\\nthough the motives which governed me may to you very\\r\\nnaturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having\\r\\ninjured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you\\r\\nthe whole of his connection with my family.  Of what he has\\r\\nPARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of\\r\\nwhat I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of\\r\\nundoubted veracity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\\r\\nmany years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and\\r\\nwhose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally\\r\\ninclined my father to be of service to him; and on George\\r\\nWickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore\\r\\nliberally bestowed.  My father supported him at school, and\\r\\nafterwards at Cambridge-- most important assistance, as his own\\r\\nfather, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would\\r\\nhave been unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education.  My\\r\\nfather was not only fond of this young man\\'s society, whose\\r\\nmanner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of\\r\\nhim, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to\\r\\nprovide for him in it.  As for myself, it is many, many years since\\r\\nI first began to think of him in a very different manner.  The\\r\\nvicious propensities-- the want of principle, which he was careful\\r\\nto guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\\r\\nthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with\\r\\nhimself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded\\r\\nmoments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.  Here again shall\\r\\ngive you pain-- to what degree you only can tell.  But whatever\\r\\nmay be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\\r\\n\\r\\nsuspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\\r\\nreal character-- it adds even another motive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his\\r\\nattachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his\\r\\nwill he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\\r\\nadvancement in the best manner that his profession might\\r\\nallow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\\r\\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant.  There was also a\\r\\nlegacy of one thousand pounds.  His own father did not long\\r\\nsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\r\\nWickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved\\r\\nagainst taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\\r\\nunreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\\r\\nadvantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\\r\\nbenefited.  He had some intention, he added, of studying law,\\r\\nand I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be a very insufficient support therein.  I rather wished,\\r\\nthan believed him to be sincere-- but, at any rate, was perfectly\\r\\nready to accede to his proposal.  I knew that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon\\r\\nsettled-- he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it\\r\\npossible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and\\r\\naccepted in return three thousand pounds.  All connection\\r\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved.  I thought too ill of him to\\r\\ninvite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.  In town I\\r\\nbelieve he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere\\r\\npretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life\\r\\nof idleness and dissipation.  For about three years I heard little of\\r\\nhim; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had\\r\\nbeen designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the\\r\\npresentation.  His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had found\\r\\nthe law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\\r\\nresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living\\r\\nin question-- of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as\\r\\nhe was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\\r\\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions.\\r\\nYou will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this\\r\\nentreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it.  His resentment\\r\\nwas in proportion to the distress of his circumstances-- and he\\r\\nwas doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\\r\\nreproaches to myself.  After this period every appearance of\\r\\nacquaintance was dropped.  How he lived I know not.  But last\\r\\nsummer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to\\r\\nforget myself, and which no obligation less than the present\\r\\nshould induce me to unfold to any human being.  Having said\\r\\nthus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My sister, who is\\r\\nmore than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of\\r\\nmy mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.  About a\\r\\nyear ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment\\r\\nformed for her in London; and last summer she went with the\\r\\nlady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went\\r\\nMr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have\\r\\nbeen a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in\\r\\nwhose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her\\r\\nconnivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to\\r\\nGeorgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression\\r\\nof his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to\\r\\nbelieve herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.  She was\\r\\nthen but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\\r\\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it\\r\\nto herself.  I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\\r\\nintended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\\r\\nidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost\\r\\nlooked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.  You\\r\\nmay imagine what I felt and how I acted.  Regard for my sister\\'s\\r\\ncredit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to\\r\\nMr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge\\r\\nwas of course removed from her charge.  Mr. Wickham\\'s object\\r\\nwas unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which is thirty thousand\\r\\npounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\\r\\nhimself on me was a strong inducement.  His revenge would\\r\\nhave been complete indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\\r\\nhave been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\\r\\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of\\r\\ncruelty towards Mr. Wickham.  I know not in what manner,\\r\\nunder what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his\\r\\nsuccess is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you\\r\\npreviously were of everything concerning either.  Detection\\r\\ncould not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your\\r\\ninclination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last\\r\\nnight; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what\\r\\ncould or ought to be revealed.  For the truth of everything here\\r\\n\\r\\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and\\r\\nconstant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my\\r\\nfather\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every\\r\\nparticular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of ME\\r\\nshould make MY assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\\r\\nby the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there\\r\\nmay be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to\\r\\nfind some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\\r\\ncourse of the morning.  I will only add, God bless you,\\r\\n                                   \"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 36\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect\\r\\nit to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no\\r\\nexpectation at all of its contents.  But such as they were, it may\\r\\nwell be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what\\r\\na contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as she read\\r\\nwere scarcely to be defined.  With amazement did she first\\r\\nunderstand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\\r\\nsteadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\r\\nto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.  With a\\r\\nstrong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his\\r\\naccount of what had happened at Netherfield.  She read with an\\r\\neagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and\\r\\nfrom impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring,\\r\\nwas incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her\\r\\neyes. His belief of her sister\\'s insensibility she instantly resolved\\r\\nto be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to\\r\\nthe match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him\\r\\njustice.  He expressed no regret for what he had done which\\r\\nsatisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.  It was all\\r\\npride and insolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\r\\nWickham-- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a\\r\\nrelation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished\\r\\nopinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to\\r\\nhis own history of himself-- her feelings were yet more acutely\\r\\npainful and more difficult of definition.  Astonishment,\\r\\napprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.  She wished to\\r\\ndiscredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cannot be!  This must be the grossest falsehood!\"-- and\\r\\nwhen she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely\\r\\nknowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away,\\r\\nprotesting that she would not regard it, that she would never\\r\\nlook in it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\r\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the\\r\\nletter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she\\r\\ncould, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related\\r\\nto Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the\\r\\nmeaning of every sentence.  The account of his connection with\\r\\nthe Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself;\\r\\nand the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not\\r\\nbefore known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\\r\\nwords.  So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she\\r\\ncame to the will, the difference was great.  What Wickham had\\r\\nsaid of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled\\r\\nhis very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross\\r\\nduplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she\\r\\nflattered herself that her wishes did not err.  But when she read\\r\\nand re-read with the closest attention, the particulars\\r\\nimmediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions to\\r\\nthe living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\r\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.  She put\\r\\ndown the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she\\r\\nmeant to be impartiality-- deliberated on the probability of each\\r\\nstatement-- but with little success.  On both sides it was only\\r\\nassertion.  Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly\\r\\nthat the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any\\r\\ncontrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy\\'s conduct\\r\\nin it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make\\r\\nhim entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not\\r\\nto lay at Mr. Wickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the\\r\\nmore so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.  She had\\r\\nnever heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia,\\r\\nin which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man\\r\\nwho, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a\\r\\nslight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life nothing had been\\r\\nknown in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.  As to his real\\r\\ncharacter, had information been in her power, she had never felt\\r\\na wish of inquiring.  His countenance, voice, and manner had\\r\\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue.  She\\r\\n\\r\\ntried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\\r\\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\\r\\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue,\\r\\natone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour\\r\\nto class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of\\r\\nmany years\\' continuance.  But no such recollection befriended\\r\\nher.  She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of\\r\\nair and address; but she could remember no more substantial\\r\\ngood than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\\r\\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.\\r\\nAfter pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more\\r\\ncontinued to read.  But, alas! the story which followed, of his\\r\\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what\\r\\nhad passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the\\r\\nmorning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of\\r\\nevery particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself-- from whom she\\r\\nhad previously received the information of his near concern in all\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to\\r\\nquestion.  At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\\r\\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the\\r\\napplication, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\\r\\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had\\r\\nnot been well assured of his cousin\\'s corroboration.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\\r\\nconversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening\\r\\nat Mr. Phillips\\'s.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in her\\r\\nmemory.  She was NOW struck with the impropriety of such\\r\\ncommunications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her\\r\\nbefore.  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he\\r\\nhad done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his\\r\\nconduct.  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\r\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy-- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country,\\r\\nbut that HE should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the\\r\\nNetherfield ball the very next week.  She remembered also that,\\r\\ntill the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his\\r\\nstory to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had\\r\\nbeen everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no\\r\\nscruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\\'s character, though he had assured\\r\\nher that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing\\r\\nthe son.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was\\r\\nconcerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the\\r\\nconsequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the\\r\\n\\r\\nmediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his\\r\\nwishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.  His behaviour to\\r\\nherself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either\\r\\nbeen deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\r\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she\\r\\nhad most incautiously shown.  Every lingering struggle in his\\r\\nfavour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when questioned by\\r\\nJane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that\\r\\nproud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the\\r\\nwhole course of their acquaintance-- an acquaintance which\\r\\nhad latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of\\r\\nintimacy with his ways-- seen anything that betrayed him to be\\r\\nunprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or\\r\\nimmoral habits; that among his own connections he was\\r\\nesteemed and valued-- that even Wickham had allowed him\\r\\nmerit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so\\r\\naffectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some\\r\\namiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham\\r\\nrepresented them, so gross a violation of everything right could\\r\\nhardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship\\r\\nbetween a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as\\r\\nBingley, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.  Of neither Darcy nor\\r\\nWickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,\\r\\npartial, prejudiced, absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided\\r\\nmyself on my discernment!  I, who have valued myself on my\\r\\nabilities!  who have often disdained the generous candour of my\\r\\nsister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\r\\nHow humiliating is this discovery!  yet, how just a humiliation!\\r\\nHad I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\r\\nBut vanity, not love, has been my folly.  Pleased with the\\r\\npreference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on\\r\\nthe very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\r\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where\\r\\neither were concerned.  Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n>From herself to Jane-- from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were\\r\\nin a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nexplanation THERE had appeared very insufficient, and she read\\r\\nit again.  Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\r\\nHow could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich she had been obliged to give in the other?  He declared\\r\\nhimself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister\\'s attachment; and\\r\\nshe could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s opinion had\\r\\nalways been.  Neither could she deny the justice of his\\r\\ndescription of Jane.  She felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent,\\r\\nwere little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency\\r\\nin her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\r\\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her\\r\\nsense of shame was severe.  The justice of the charge struck her\\r\\ntoo forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he\\r\\nparticularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and\\r\\nas confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a\\r\\nstronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.  It\\r\\nsoothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had\\r\\nthus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she\\r\\nconsidered that Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work\\r\\nof her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit\\r\\nof both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt\\r\\ndepressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to\\r\\nevery variety of thought--re-considering events, determining\\r\\nprobabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a\\r\\nchange so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection\\r\\nof her long absence, made her at length return home; and she\\r\\nentered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,\\r\\nand the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make\\r\\nher unfit for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings\\r\\nhad each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few\\r\\nminutes, to take leave-- but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been\\r\\nsitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and\\r\\nalmost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\r\\nElizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing him; she\\r\\nreally rejoiced at it.  Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an\\r\\nobject; she could think only of her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 37\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr.\\r\\nCollins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his\\r\\nparting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing\\r\\nintelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as\\r\\ntolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene\\r\\nso lately gone through at Rosings.  To Rosings he then hastened,\\r\\nto console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\r\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her\\r\\nladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her\\r\\nvery desirous of having them all to dine with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\\r\\nhad she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to\\r\\nher as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of\\r\\nwhat her ladyship\\'s indignation would have been.  \"What would\\r\\nshe have said? how would she have behaved?\" were questions\\r\\nwith which she amused herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.  \"I\\r\\nassure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe\\r\\nno one feels the loss of friends so much as I do.  But I am\\r\\nparticularly attached to these young men, and know them to be\\r\\nso much attached to me!  They were excessively sorry to go!\\r\\nBut so they always are.  The dear Colonel rallied his spirits\\r\\ntolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,\\r\\nmore, I think, than last year.  His attachment to Rosings\\r\\ncertainly increases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\\r\\nwhich were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\\r\\nout of spirits. And immediately accounting for it by herself, by\\r\\nsupposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg\\r\\nthat you may stay a little longer.  Mrs. Collins will be very glad\\r\\nof your company, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\"\\r\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it.  I must\\r\\nbe in town next Saturday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.  I\\r\\nexpected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs. Collins so before\\r\\nyou came.  There can be no occasion for your going so soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my father cannot.  He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\r\\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father.  And if\\r\\nyou will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in my power\\r\\nto take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in\\r\\nJune, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the\\r\\nbarouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--\\r\\nand indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not\\r\\nobject to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by\\r\\nour original plan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.  \"Mrs. Collins, you must send\\r\\na servant with them.  You know I always speak my mind, and I\\r\\ncannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by\\r\\nthemselves.  It is highly improper.  You must contrive to send\\r\\nsomebody.  I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of\\r\\nthing.  Young women should always be properly guarded and\\r\\nattended, according to their situation in life.  When my niece\\r\\nGeorgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\r\\nhaving two men-servants go with her.  Miss Darcy, the daughter\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have\\r\\nappeared with propriety in a different manner.  I am excessively\\r\\nattentive to all those things.  You must send John with the young\\r\\nladies, Mrs. Collins.  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it;\\r\\nfor it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go\\r\\nalone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Your uncle!  He keeps a man-servant, does he?  I am very\\r\\nglad you have somebody who thinks of these things.  Where\\r\\nshall you change horses?  Oh!  Bromley, of course.  If you\\r\\nmention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\\r\\njourney, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was\\r\\nnecessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with\\r\\n\\r\\na mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nReflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she\\r\\nwas alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day\\r\\nwent by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all\\r\\nthe delight of unpleasant recollections.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by\\r\\nheart.  She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its\\r\\nwriter were at times widely different.  When she remembered the\\r\\nstyle of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she\\r\\nconsidered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,\\r\\nher anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed\\r\\nfeelings became the object of compassion.  His attachment\\r\\nexcited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could\\r\\nnot approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\\r\\nor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.  In her\\r\\nown past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation\\r\\nand regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a constant\\r\\nsource of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her\\r\\nfamily, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.  They were hopeless of\\r\\nremedy.  Her father, contented with laughing at them, would\\r\\nnever exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest\\r\\ndaughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\r\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nfrequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the\\r\\nimprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were\\r\\nsupported by their mother\\'s indulgence, what chance could there\\r\\nbe of improvement?  Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and\\r\\ncompletely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always affronted\\r\\nby their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\r\\nscarcely give them a hearing.  They were ignorant, idle, and vain.\\r\\nWhile there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him;\\r\\nand while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would\\r\\nbe going there forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former\\r\\ngood opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.  His\\r\\naffection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct\\r\\ncleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness\\r\\nof his confidence in his friend.  How grievous then was the\\r\\nthought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so\\r\\nreplete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\r\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\\r\\nweek of her stay as they had been at first.  The very last evening\\r\\nwas spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into\\r\\nthe particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the\\r\\nbest method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of\\r\\nplacing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself\\r\\nobliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and\\r\\npack her trunk afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\\r\\nwished them a good journey, and invited them to come to\\r\\nHunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so\\r\\nfar as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 38\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for\\r\\nbreakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took\\r\\nthe opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed\\r\\nindispensably necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has\\r\\nyet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I\\r\\nam very certain you will not leave the house without receiving\\r\\nher thanks for it.  The favor of your company has been much\\r\\nfelt, I assure you.  We know how little there is to tempt any one\\r\\nto our humble abode.  Our plain manner of living, our small\\r\\nrooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world,\\r\\nmust make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\r\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the\\r\\ncondescension, and that we have done everything in our power\\r\\nto prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of\\r\\nhappiness.  She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and\\r\\nthe pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she\\r\\nhad received, must make HER feel the obliged.  Mr. Collins was\\r\\ngratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\r\\ntime not disagreeably.  We have certainly done our best; and\\r\\nmost fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to  very\\r\\nsuperior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the\\r\\n\\r\\nfrequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we\\r\\nmay flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been\\r\\nentirely irksome.  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nfamily is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing\\r\\nwhich few can boast.  You see on what a footing we are.  You\\r\\nsee how continually we are engaged there.  In truth I must\\r\\nacknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble\\r\\nparsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\\r\\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he\\r\\nwas obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to\\r\\nunite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\r\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin.  I flatter myself at least that you\\r\\nwill be able to do so. Lady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs.\\r\\nCollins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it\\r\\ndoes not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate----\\r\\nBut on this point it will be as well to be silent.  Only let me\\r\\nassure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart\\r\\nmost cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.  My dear\\r\\nCharlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.\\r\\nThere is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\r\\ncharacter and ideas between us.  We seem to have been designed\\r\\nfor each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where\\r\\nthat was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she\\r\\nfirmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was\\r\\nnot sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the\\r\\nlady from whom they sprang.  Poor Charlotte!  it was\\r\\nmelancholy to leave her to such society!  But she had chosen it\\r\\nwith her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her\\r\\nvisitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.\\r\\nHer home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and\\r\\nall their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\\r\\nparcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.  After\\r\\nan affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was\\r\\nattended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked\\r\\ndown the garden he was commissioning her with his best\\r\\nrespects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the\\r\\nkindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\r\\n\\r\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.  He\\r\\nthen handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the\\r\\npoint of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with\\r\\nsome consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any\\r\\nmessage for the ladies at Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble\\r\\nrespects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their\\r\\nkindness to you while you have been here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be\\r\\nshut, and the carriage drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes\\' silence, \"it\\r\\nseems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many\\r\\nthings have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\\r\\ntwice!  How much I shall have to tell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth added privately, \"And how much I shall have to\\r\\nconceal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any\\r\\nalarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they\\r\\nreached Mr. Gardiner\\'s house, where they were to remain a few\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of\\r\\nstudying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the\\r\\nkindness of her aunt had reserved for them.  But Jane was to go\\r\\nhome with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough\\r\\nfor observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait\\r\\neven for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nproposals.  To know that she had the power of revealing what\\r\\nwould so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time,\\r\\nso highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet\\r\\nbeen able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as\\r\\nnothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in\\r\\nwhich she remained as to the extent of what she should\\r\\ncommunicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of\\r\\n\\r\\nbeing hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might\\r\\nonly grieve her sister further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 39\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies\\r\\nset out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in\\r\\nHertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived,\\r\\nin token of the coachman\\'s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia\\r\\nlooking out of a dining-room upstairs.  These two girls had been\\r\\nabove an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an\\r\\nopposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a\\r\\nsalad and cucumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table\\r\\nset out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords,\\r\\nexclaiming, \"Is not this nice?  Is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you must\\r\\nlend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out\\r\\nthere.\"  Then, showing her purchases-- \"Look here, I have\\r\\nbought this bonnet.  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought\\r\\nI might as well buy it as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I\\r\\nget home, and see if I can not make it up any better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\r\\nunconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the\\r\\nshop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to\\r\\ntrim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.  Besides, it will\\r\\nnot much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire\\r\\nhave left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so\\r\\nwant papa to take us all there for the summer!  It would be such\\r\\na delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at\\r\\nall.  Mamma would like to go too of all things!  Only think what\\r\\na miserable summer else we shall have!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"THAT would be a delightful scheme\\r\\nindeed, and completely do for us at once.  Good Heaven!\\r\\nBrighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been\\r\\n\\r\\noverset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly\\r\\nballs of Meryton!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat\\r\\ndown at table.  \"What do you think?  It is excellent news--\\r\\ncapital news-- and about a certain person we all like!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told\\r\\nhe need not stay.  Lydia laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.  You\\r\\nthought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!  I dare say he\\r\\noften hears worse things said than I am going to say.  But he is\\r\\nan ugly fellow!  I am glad he is gone.  I never saw such a long\\r\\nchin in my life.  Well, but now for my news; it is about dear\\r\\nWickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?  There is no danger\\r\\nof Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King.  There\\'s for you!  She is\\r\\ngone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.  Wickham is\\r\\nsafe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a\\r\\nconnection imprudent as to fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said\\r\\nJane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure there is not on HIS.  I will answer for it, he never\\r\\ncared three straws about her-- who could about such a nasty\\r\\nlittle freckled thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\r\\ncoarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of the\\r\\nSENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had\\r\\nharboured and fancied liberal!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\r\\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all\\r\\ntheir boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition\\r\\nof Kitty\\'s and Lydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia.  \"I am glad I\\r\\nbought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another\\r\\nbandbox!  Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and\\r\\n\\r\\ntalk and laugh all the way home.  And in the first place, let us\\r\\nhear what has happened to you all since you went away.  Have\\r\\nyou seen any pleasant men?  Have you had any flirting?  I was in\\r\\ngreat hopes that one of you would have got a husband before\\r\\nyou came back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\r\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty!  My aunt Phillips wants you so\\r\\nto get husbands, you can\\'t think.  She says Lizzy had better have\\r\\ntaken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been\\r\\nany fun in it.  Lord! how I should like to be married before any\\r\\nof you!  and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\r\\nDear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at\\r\\nColonel Forster\\'s.  Kitty and me were to spend the day there,\\r\\nand Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening;\\r\\n(by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she\\r\\nasked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so\\r\\nPen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think\\r\\nwe did?  We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes on\\r\\npurpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!  Not a soul\\r\\nknew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me,\\r\\nexcept my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her\\r\\ngowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!  When\\r\\nDenny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the\\r\\nmen came in, they did not know him in the least.  Lord!  how I\\r\\nlaughed! and so did Mrs. Forster.  I thought I should have died.\\r\\nAnd THAT made the men suspect something, and then they\\r\\nsoon found out what was the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\r\\nLydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to\\r\\namuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlistened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the\\r\\nfrequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception at home was most kind.  Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to\\r\\nsee Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during\\r\\ndinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\\r\\nLucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various\\r\\nwere the subjects that occupied them:  Lady Lucas was inquiring\\r\\nof Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter;\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an\\r\\naccount of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way\\r\\n\\r\\nbelow her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\\r\\nLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other\\r\\nperson\\'s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning\\r\\nto anybody who would hear her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had\\r\\nsuch fun!  As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and\\r\\npretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have\\r\\ngone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got\\r\\nto the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we\\r\\ntreated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the\\r\\nworld, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you\\r\\ntoo.  And then when we came away it was such fun!  I thought\\r\\nwe never should have got into the coach.  I was ready to die of\\r\\nlaughter.  And then we were so merry all the way home!  we\\r\\ntalked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us\\r\\nten miles off!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear\\r\\nsister, to depreciate such pleasures!  They would doubtless be\\r\\ncongenial with the generality of female minds.  But I confess\\r\\nthey would have no charms for ME-- I should infinitely prefer a\\r\\nbook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word.  She seldom listened\\r\\nto anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to\\r\\nMary at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to\\r\\nwalk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but\\r\\nElizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.  It should not be said\\r\\nthat the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before\\r\\nthey were in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason\\r\\ntoo for her opposition.  She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again,\\r\\nand was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.  The comfort to\\r\\nHER of the regiment\\'s approaching removal was indeed beyond\\r\\nexpression.  In a fortnight they were to go-- and once gone, she\\r\\nhoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the\\r\\nBrighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the\\r\\ninn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.\\r\\nElizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest\\r\\nintention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so\\r\\nvague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\r\\n\\r\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 40\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\\r\\ncould no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to\\r\\nsuppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and\\r\\npreparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next\\r\\nmorning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong\\r\\nsisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear\\r\\nperfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other\\r\\nfeelings.  She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his\\r\\nsentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but\\r\\nstill more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\'s\\r\\nrefusal must have given him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and\\r\\ncertainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it\\r\\nmust increase his disappointment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he\\r\\nhas other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his\\r\\nregard for me.  You do not blame me, however, for refusing\\r\\nhim?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blame you!  Oh, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened the very\\r\\nnext day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents\\r\\nas far as they concerned George Wickham.  What a stroke was\\r\\nthis for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the\\r\\nworld without believing that so much wickedness existed in the\\r\\nwhole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.\\r\\nNor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings,\\r\\n\\r\\ncapable of consoling her for such discovery.  Most earnestly did\\r\\nshe labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the\\r\\none without involving the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to\\r\\nmake both of them good for anything.  Take your choice, but\\r\\nyou must be satisfied with only one.  There is but such a quantity\\r\\nof merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of\\r\\nman; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.  For my\\r\\npart, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\\'s; but you shall do as\\r\\nyou choose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted\\r\\nfrom Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Wickham so very bad!  It is almost past belief.  And poor Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\\r\\nSuch a disappointment!  and with the knowledge of your ill\\r\\nopinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister!  It is\\r\\nreally too distressing.  I am sure you must feel it so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing\\r\\nyou so full of both.  I know you will do him such ample justice,\\r\\nthat I am growing every moment more unconcerned and\\r\\nindifferent.  Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament\\r\\nover him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\r\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the\\r\\neducation of those two young men.  One has got all the\\r\\ngoodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the APPEARANCE\\r\\nof it as you used to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided\\r\\na dislike to him, without any reason.  It is such a spur to one\\'s\\r\\ngenius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\r\\nOne may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but\\r\\none cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then\\r\\nstumbling on something witty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not\\r\\ntreat the matter as you do now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I could not.  I was uncomfortable enough, I may say\\r\\nunhappy.  And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no\\r\\nJane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and\\r\\nvain and nonsensical as I knew I had!  Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong\\r\\nexpressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they\\r\\nDO appear wholly undeserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a\\r\\nmost natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\\r\\nencouraging.  There is one point on which I want your advice.  I\\r\\nwant to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our\\r\\nacquaintances in general understand Wickham\\'s character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can\\r\\nbe no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.  What is your\\r\\nopinion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted.  Mr. Darcy has not\\r\\nauthorised me to make his communication public.  On the\\r\\ncontrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be\\r\\nkept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to\\r\\nundeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe\\r\\nme?  The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that\\r\\nit would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to\\r\\nattempt to place him in an amiable light.  I am not equal to it.\\r\\nWickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\\r\\nanyone here what he really is.  Some time hence it will be all\\r\\nfound out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not\\r\\nknowing it before.  At present I will say nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right.  To have his errors made public might ruin\\r\\nhim for ever.  He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done,\\r\\nand anxious to re-establish a character.  We must not make him\\r\\ndesperate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\r\\nShe had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her\\r\\nfor a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,\\r\\nwhenever she might wish to talk again of either.  But there was\\r\\nstill something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the\\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosure.  She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nletter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been\\r\\nvalued by her friend.  Here was knowledge in which no one\\r\\ncould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a\\r\\nperfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\\r\\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery.  \"And then,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall\\r\\nmerely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more\\r\\nagreeable manner himself.  The liberty of communication cannot\\r\\nbe mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\\r\\nreal state of her sister\\'s spirits.  Jane was not happy.  She still\\r\\ncherished a very tender affection for Bingley.  Having never even\\r\\nfancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of\\r\\nfirst attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater\\r\\nsteadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so\\r\\nfervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every\\r\\nother man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\r\\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of\\r\\nthose regrets which must have been injurious to her own health\\r\\nand their tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion\\r\\nNOW of this sad business of Jane\\'s?  For my part, I am\\r\\ndetermined never to speak of it again to anybody.  I told my\\r\\nsister Phillips so the other day.  But I cannot find out that Jane\\r\\nsaw anything of him in London.  Well, he is a very undeserving\\r\\nyoung man-- and I do not suppose there\\'s the least chance in the\\r\\nworld of her ever getting him now.  There is no talk of his\\r\\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired\\r\\nof everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses.  Nobody wants him to come.\\r\\nThough I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and\\r\\nif I was her, I would not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort\\r\\nis, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be\\r\\nsorry for what he has done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\\r\\nexpectation, she made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Collinses live very comfortable, do they?  Well, well, I only\\r\\nhope it will last.  And what sort of table do they keep?  Charlotte\\r\\nis an excellent manager, I dare say.  If she is half as sharp as her\\r\\nmother, she is saving enough.  There is nothing extravagant in\\r\\nTHEIR housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.  Yes, yes.\\r\\nTHEY will take care not to outrun their income.  THEY will\\r\\nnever be distressed for money.  Well, much good may it do\\r\\nthem!  And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  They look upon it as quite their own,\\r\\nI dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no\\r\\ndoubt they often talk of it between themselves.  Well, if they can\\r\\nbe easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the\\r\\nbetter.  I should be ashamed of having one that was only\\r\\nentailed on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 41\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.\\r\\nIt was the last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the\\r\\nyoung ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.  The\\r\\ndejection was almost universal.  The elder Miss Bennets alone\\r\\nwere still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual\\r\\ncourse of their employments.  Very frequently were they\\r\\nreproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own\\r\\nmisery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\r\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us?  What are we to do?\"\\r\\nwould they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe.  \"How can\\r\\nyou be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\\r\\nwhat she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty\\r\\nyears ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when\\r\\nColonel Miller\\'s regiment went away.  I thought I should have\\r\\nbroken my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I shall break MINE,\" said Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!-- if one could but go to Brighton!  But papa is so\\r\\ndisagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal of\\r\\ngood,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually\\r\\nthrough Longbourn House.  Elizabeth tried to be diverted by\\r\\nthem; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.  She felt anew\\r\\nthe justice of Mr. Darcy\\'s objections; and never had she been so\\r\\nmuch disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\\r\\nshe received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the\\r\\ncolonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.  This\\r\\ninvaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately\\r\\nmarried.  A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had\\r\\nrecommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their\\r\\nTHREE months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate TWO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\r\\nForster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of\\r\\nKitty, are scarcely to be described.  Wholly inattentive to her\\r\\nsister\\'s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy,\\r\\ncalling for every one\\'s congratulations, and laughing and talking\\r\\nwith more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued\\r\\nin the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her\\r\\naccent was peevish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well as\\r\\nLydia,\" said she, \"Though I am NOT her particular friend.  I\\r\\nhave just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for\\r\\nI am two years older.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane\\r\\nto make her resigned.  As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation\\r\\nwas so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother\\r\\nand Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all\\r\\npossibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such\\r\\na step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly\\r\\nadvising her father not to let her go.  She represented to him all\\r\\nthe improprieties of Lydia\\'s general behaviour, the little\\r\\nadvantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman\\r\\nas Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\r\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the\\r\\ntemptations must be greater than at home.  He heard her\\r\\nattentively, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\\r\\npublic place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with\\r\\nso little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the\\r\\npresent circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great\\r\\ndisadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of\\r\\nLydia\\'s unguarded and imprudent manner-- nay, which has\\r\\nalready arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in\\r\\nthe affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet.  \"What, has she\\r\\nfrightened away some of your lovers?  Poor little Lizzy!  But do\\r\\nnot be cast down.  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be\\r\\nconnected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.  Come,\\r\\nlet me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by\\r\\nLydia\\'s folly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken.  I have no such injuries to resent.  It is\\r\\nnot of particular, but of general evils, which I am now\\r\\ncomplaining.  Our importance, our respectability in the world\\r\\nmust be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain\\r\\nof all restraint which mark Lydia\\'s character.  Excuse me, for I\\r\\nmust speak plainly.  If you, my dear father, will not take the\\r\\ntrouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her\\r\\nthat her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she\\r\\nwill soon be beyond the reach of amendment.  Her character will\\r\\nbe fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\r\\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\\r\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction\\r\\nbeyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance\\r\\n\\r\\nand emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any\\r\\nportion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration\\r\\nwill excite.  In this danger Kitty also is comprehended.  She will\\r\\nfollow wherever Lydia leads.  Vain, ignorant, idle, and\\r\\nabsolutely uncontrolled!  Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it\\r\\npossible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\r\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved\\r\\nin the disgrace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\r\\naffectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane\\r\\nare known you must be respected and valued; and you will not\\r\\nappear to less advantage for having a couple of-- or I may say,\\r\\nthree-- very silly sisters.  We shall have no peace at Longbourn if\\r\\nLydia does not go to Brighton.  Let her go, then.  Colonel\\r\\nForster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real\\r\\nmischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to\\r\\nanybody.  At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a\\r\\ncommon flirt than she has been here.  The officers will find\\r\\nwomen better worth their notice.  Let us hope, therefore, that\\r\\nher being there may teach her her own insignificance.  At any\\r\\nrate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising\\r\\nus to lock her up for the rest of her life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her\\r\\nown opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed\\r\\nand sorry.  It was not in her nature, however, to increase her\\r\\nvexations by dwelling on them.  She was confident of having\\r\\nperformed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or\\r\\naugment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her\\r\\nconference with her father, their indignation would hardly have\\r\\nfound expression in their united volubility.  In Lydia\\'s\\r\\nimagination, a visit to Brighton comprised ever possibility of\\r\\nearthly happiness.  She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the\\r\\nstreets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.  She saw\\r\\nherself  the object to tens and to scores of them at present\\r\\nunknown.  She saw all the glories of the camp-- its tents\\r\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with\\r\\nthe young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to\\r\\ncomplete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent,\\r\\ntenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\\r\\nand such realities as these, what would have been her\\r\\nsensations?  They could have been understood only by her\\r\\nmother, who might have felt nearly the same.  Lydia\\'s going to\\r\\nBrighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction\\r\\nof her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their\\r\\nraptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of\\r\\nLydia\\'s leaving home.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.\\r\\nHaving been frequently in company with him since her return,\\r\\nagitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality\\r\\nentirely so.  She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness\\r\\nwhich had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to\\r\\ndisgust and weary.  In his present behaviour to herself,\\r\\nmoreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the\\r\\ninclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\r\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,\\r\\nafter what had since passed, to provoke her.  She lost all concern\\r\\nfor him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle\\r\\nand frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could\\r\\nnot but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however\\r\\nlong, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn,\\r\\nher vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any\\r\\ntime by their renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining at Meryton, he\\r\\ndined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was\\r\\nElizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his\\r\\nmaking some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had\\r\\npassed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and\\r\\nasked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s\\r\\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly\\r\\nseen him often; and, after observing that he was a very\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.  Her\\r\\nanswer was warmly in his favour.  With an air of indifference he\\r\\nsoon afterwards added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very different.  But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape\\r\\nher.  \"And pray, may I ask?-- \"  But checking himself, he added,\\r\\nin a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves?  Has he\\r\\ndeigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?-- for I dare\\r\\nnot hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone, \"that\\r\\nhe is improved in essentials.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth.  \"In essentials, I believe, he is very\\r\\nmuch what he ever was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing\\r\\nwhether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.\\r\\nThere was a something in her countenance which made him\\r\\nlisten with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\\r\\nthat his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but\\r\\nthat, from knowing him better, his disposition was better\\r\\nunderstood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\\r\\nagitated look; for a few minuted he was silent, till, shaking off\\r\\nhis embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the\\r\\ngentlest of accents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will\\r\\nreadily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise\\r\\nenough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is right.\\r\\nHis pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself,\\r\\nto many others, for it must only deter him from such foul\\r\\nmisconduct as I have suffered by.  I only fear that the sort of\\r\\ncautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\\r\\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion\\r\\n\\r\\nand judgement he stands much in awe.  His fear of her has\\r\\nalways operated, I know, when they were together; and a good\\r\\ndeal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with\\r\\nMiss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only\\r\\nby a slight inclination of the head.  She saw that he wanted to\\r\\nengage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in\\r\\nno humour to indulge him.  The rest of the evening passed with\\r\\nthe APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with\\r\\nno further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at\\r\\nlast with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never\\r\\nmeeting again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\\r\\nMeryton, from whence they were to set out early the next\\r\\nmorning.  The separation between her and her family was rather\\r\\nnoisy than pathetic.  Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but\\r\\nshe did weep from vexation and envy.  Mrs. Bennet was diffuse\\r\\nin her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and\\r\\nimpressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\\r\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible-- advice\\r\\nwhich there was every reason to believe would be well attended\\r\\nto; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding\\r\\nfarewell, the more gentle adieux of her sisters were uttered\\r\\nwithout being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 42\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Elizabeth\\'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\\r\\ncould not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal\\r\\nfelicity or domestic comfort.  Her father, captivated by youth\\r\\nand beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth\\r\\nand beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak\\r\\nunderstanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage\\r\\nput and end to all real affection for her.  Respect, esteem, and\\r\\nconfidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic\\r\\nhappiness were overthrown.  But Mr. Bennet was not of a\\r\\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his\\r\\nown imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which\\r\\ntoo often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice.  He\\r\\nwas fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had\\r\\narisen his principal enjoyments.  To his wife he was very little\\r\\n\\r\\notherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had\\r\\ncontributed to his amusement.  This is not the sort of happiness\\r\\nwhich a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but\\r\\nwhere other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\r\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of\\r\\nher father\\'s behaviour as a husband.  She had always seen it with\\r\\npain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate\\r\\ntreatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could\\r\\nnot overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual\\r\\nbreach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing\\r\\nhis wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly\\r\\nreprehensible.  But she had never felt so strongly as now the\\r\\ndisadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a\\r\\nmarriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from\\r\\nso ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\\r\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,\\r\\neven if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure she\\r\\nfound little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the\\r\\nregiment.  Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and\\r\\nat home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at\\r\\nthe dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over\\r\\ntheir domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her\\r\\nnatural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were\\r\\nremoved, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil\\r\\nmight be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly\\r\\nand assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\r\\nwatering-place and a camp.  Upon the whole, therefore, she\\r\\nfound, what has been sometimes been found before, that an\\r\\nevent to which she had been looking with impatient desire did\\r\\nnot, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised\\r\\nherself.  It was consequently necessary to name some other\\r\\nperiod for the commencement of actual felicity-- to have some\\r\\nother point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and\\r\\nby again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for\\r\\nthe present, and prepare for another disappointment.  Her tour\\r\\nto the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was\\r\\nher best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the\\r\\ndiscontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and\\r\\ncould she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it\\r\\nwould have been perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish\\r\\nfor.  Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment\\r\\nwould be certain.  But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless\\r\\nsource of regret in my sister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to\\r\\nhave all my expectations of pleasure realised.  A scheme of\\r\\nwhich every part promises delight can never be successful; and\\r\\ngeneral disappointment is only warded off by the defence of\\r\\nsome little peculiar vexation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and\\r\\nvery minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were\\r\\nalways long expected, and always very short.  Those to her\\r\\nmother contained little else than that they were just returned\\r\\nfrom the library, where such and such officers had attended\\r\\nthem, and where she had seen such beautiful  ornaments as made\\r\\nher quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\r\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave\\r\\noff in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were\\r\\ngoing off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her\\r\\nsister,  there was still less to be learnt-- for her letters to Kitty,\\r\\nthough rather longer, were much too full of lines under the\\r\\nwords to be made public.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\r\\ngood humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\r\\nEverything wore a happier aspect.  The families who had been in\\r\\ntown for the winter came back again, and summer finery and\\r\\nsummer engagements arose.  Mrs. Bennet was restored to her\\r\\nusual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was\\r\\nso much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears;\\r\\nan event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that\\r\\nby the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable\\r\\nas not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some\\r\\ncruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another\\r\\nregiment should be quartered in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\\r\\nfast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a\\r\\nletter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its\\r\\ncommencement and curtailed its extent.  Mr. Gardiner would be\\r\\nprevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in\\r\\nJuly, and must be in London again within a month, and as that\\r\\nleft too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much\\r\\nas they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and\\r\\ncomfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the\\r\\n\\r\\nLakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to\\r\\nthe present plan, were to go no farther northwards than\\r\\nDerbyshire.  In that county there was enough to be seen to\\r\\noccupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it\\r\\nhad a peculiarly strong attraction.  The town where she had\\r\\nformerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now\\r\\nto spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her\\r\\ncuriosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\r\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\\r\\nseeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time\\r\\nenough.  But it was her business to be satisfied-- and certainly\\r\\nher temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas\\r\\nconnected.  It was impossible for her to see the word without\\r\\nthinking of Pemberley and its owner.  \"But surely,\" said she, \"I\\r\\nmay enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few\\r\\npetrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled.  Four weeks were\\r\\nto pass away before her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival.  But they did\\r\\npass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children,\\r\\ndid at length appear at Longbourn.  The children, two girls of six\\r\\nand eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under\\r\\nthe particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general\\r\\nfavourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper\\r\\nexactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--\\r\\nteaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off\\r\\nthe next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and\\r\\namusement.  One enjoyment was certain-- that of suitableness of\\r\\ncompanions; a suitableness which comprehended health and\\r\\ntemper to bear inconveniences-- cheerfulness to enhance every\\r\\npleasure-- and affection and intelligence, which might supply it\\r\\namong themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of\\r\\nDerbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which\\r\\ntheir route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,\\r\\nBirmingham, &c., are sufficiently known.  A small part of\\r\\nDerbyshire is all the present concern.  To the little town of\\r\\nLambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s former residence, and\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained,\\r\\nthey bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders\\r\\nof the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth\\r\\nfound from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.  It was not in\\r\\ntheir direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.  In\\r\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner\\r\\nexpressed an inclination to see the place again.  Mr. Gardiner\\r\\ndeclared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her\\r\\napprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\\r\\nheard so much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so\\r\\nmany of your acquaintances are connected.  Wickham passed all\\r\\nhis youth there, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was distressed.  She felt that she had no business at\\r\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\\r\\nit.  She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\\r\\ngoing over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\\r\\nsatin curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.  If it were merely a fine\\r\\nhouse richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it\\r\\nmyself; but the grounds are delightful.  They have some of the\\r\\nfinest woods in the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said no more-- but her mind could not acquiesce.  The\\r\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\\r\\ninstantly occurred.  It would be dreadful!  She blushed at the\\r\\nvery idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her\\r\\naunt than to run such a risk.  But against this there were\\r\\nobjections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last\\r\\nresource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family\\r\\nwere unfavourably answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the\\r\\nchambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\\r\\nwhat was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm,\\r\\nwhether the family were down for the summer?  A most\\r\\nwelcome negative followed the last question-- and her alarms\\r\\nnow being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\r\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was\\r\\nrevived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could\\r\\nreadily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had\\r\\nnot really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore,\\r\\nthey were to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 43\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\\r\\nof Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at\\r\\nlength they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high\\r\\nflutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\r\\nThey entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\\r\\ntime through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\\r\\nadmired every remarkable spot and point of view.  They\\r\\ngradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves\\r\\nat the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,\\r\\nand the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated\\r\\non the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some\\r\\nabruptness wound.  It was a large, handsome stone building,\\r\\nstanding well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\\r\\nwoody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance\\r\\nwas swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.\\r\\nIts banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwas delighted.  She had never seen a place for which nature had\\r\\ndone more, or where natural beauty had been so little\\r\\ncounteracted by an awkward taste.  They were all of them warm\\r\\nin their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be\\r\\nmistress of Pemberley might be something!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\\r\\ndoor; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all\\r\\nher apprehension of meeting its owner returned.  She dreaded\\r\\nlest the chambermaid had been mistaken.  On applying to see\\r\\nthe place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as\\r\\nthey waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her\\r\\nbeing where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman,\\r\\nmuch less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of\\r\\nfinding her.  They followed her into the dining-parlour.  It was\\r\\na large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.\\r\\nElizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy\\r\\nits prospect.  The hill, crowned with wood, which they had\\r\\ndescended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\\r\\nwas a beautiful object.  Every disposition of the ground was\\r\\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees\\r\\nscattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as\\r\\nshe could trace it, with delight.  As they passed into other\\r\\nrooms these objects were taking different positions; but from\\r\\nevery window there were beauties to be seen.  The rooms were\\r\\nlofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune\\r\\nof its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste,\\r\\nthat it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\\r\\nsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress!\\r\\nWith these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\r\\nInstead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in\\r\\nthem as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle\\r\\nand aunt.  But no,\" recollecting herself-- \"that could never be;\\r\\nmy uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not\\r\\nhave been allowed to invite them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a lucky recollection-- it saved her from something\\r\\nvery like regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master\\r\\nwas really absent, but had not the courage for it.  At length\\r\\nhowever, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned\\r\\naway with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was,\\r\\nadding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of\\r\\nfriends.\"  How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey\\r\\nhad not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture.  She approached\\r\\nand saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst\\r\\nseveral other miniatures, over the mantelpiece.  Her aunt asked\\r\\nher, smilingly, how she liked it.  The housekeeper came forward,\\r\\nand told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of\\r\\nher late master\\'s steward, who had been brought up by him at\\r\\nhis own expense.  \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\\r\\n\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not return it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\\r\\nminiatures, \"is my master-- and very like him.  It was drawn at\\r\\nthe same time as the other-- about eight years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face.  But,\\r\\nLizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\r\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery\\r\\nupstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\r\\nThis room was my late master\\'s favourite room, and these\\r\\nminiatures are just as they used to be then.  He was very fond\\r\\nof them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\'s being among\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss\\r\\nDarcy, drawn when she was only eight\\r\\nyears old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and\\r\\nso accomplished!-- She plays and sings all day long.  In the next\\r\\nroom is a new instrument just come down for her-- a present\\r\\nfrom my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,\\r\\nencouraged her communicativeness by his questions and\\r\\nremarks:  Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had\\r\\nevidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend\\r\\nhalf his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the\\r\\nsummer months.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be.  I do not\\r\\nknow who is good enough for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.  Elizabeth could not help saying,\\r\\n\"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think\\r\\nso.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that\\r\\nknows him,\" replied the other.  Elizabeth thought this was\\r\\ngoing pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment\\r\\nas the housekeeper added, \"I have never known a cross word\\r\\nfrom him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was\\r\\nfour years old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\\r\\nto her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been\\r\\nher firmest opinion.  Her keenest attention was awakened; she\\r\\nlonged to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.  You\\r\\nare lucky in having such a master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am.  If I were to go through the world, I\\r\\ncould not meet with a better.  But I have always observed, that\\r\\nthey who are good-natured when children, are good-natured\\r\\nwhen they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered,\\r\\nmost generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth almost stared at her.  \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\nthought she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like\\r\\nhim-- just as affable to the poor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\\r\\nmore.  Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She\\r\\nrelated the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms,\\r\\nand the price of the furniture, in vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly\\r\\namused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed\\r\\nher excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to\\r\\nthe subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as\\r\\nthey proceeded together up the great staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that\\r\\never lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of\\r\\nnothing but themselves.  There is not one of his tenants or\\r\\nservants but will give him a good name.  Some people call him\\r\\nproud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.  To my fancy, it\\r\\nis only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked,\\r\\n\"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a\\r\\nvery pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance\\r\\nand lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that\\r\\nit was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had\\r\\ntaken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked\\r\\ntowards one of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she\\r\\nshould enter the room.  \"And this is always the way with him,\"\\r\\nshe added.  \"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to\\r\\nbe done in a moment.  There is nothing he would not do for\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\\r\\nwere all that remained to be shown.  In the former were many\\r\\ngood paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from\\r\\nsuch as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned\\r\\nto look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\'s, in crayons, whose\\r\\nsubjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could\\r\\nhave little to fix the attention of a stranger.  Elizabeth walked in\\r\\nquest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\r\\nAt last it arrested her-- and she beheld a striking resemblance to\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered\\r\\nto have sometimes seen when he looked at her.  She stood\\r\\nseveral minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation,\\r\\nand returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.  Mrs.\\r\\nReynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\\'s\\r\\nlifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more\\r\\ngentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\\r\\nthe height of their acquaintance.  The commendation bestowed\\r\\non him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise\\r\\nis more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?  As a\\r\\nbrother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\'s\\r\\nhappiness were in his guardianship!-- how much of pleasure or\\r\\npain was it in his power to bestow!-- how much of good or evil\\r\\nmust be done by him!  Every idea that had been brought forward\\r\\nby the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\\r\\nstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed\\r\\nhis eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper\\r\\nsentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she\\r\\nremembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of\\r\\nexpression.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had\\r\\nbeen seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\\r\\nhousekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met\\r\\nthem at the hall-door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\\r\\nturned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\\r\\nwhile the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\\r\\nthe owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\\r\\nwhich led behind it to the stables.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\\r\\nhis appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.  Their\\r\\neyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\\r\\nthe deepest blush.  He absolutely started, and for a moment\\r\\nseemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself,\\r\\nadvanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in\\r\\nterms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\r\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to\\r\\nbe overcome.  Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to\\r\\nthe picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to\\r\\nassure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the\\r\\ngardener\\'s expression of surprise, on beholding his master,\\r\\nmust immediately have told it.  They stood a little aloof while\\r\\nhe was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\r\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what\\r\\nanswer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.\\r\\nAmazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted,\\r\\nevery sentence that he uttered was increasing her\\r\\nembarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her\\r\\nbeing found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in\\r\\nwhich they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\\r\\nher life.  Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke,\\r\\nhis accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\\r\\ninquiries as to the time of  her having left Longbourn, and of her\\r\\nhaving stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way,\\r\\nas plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\\r\\nfew moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\\r\\nhimself, and took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\\r\\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed\\r\\nby her own feelings, followed them in silence.  She was\\r\\noverpowered by shame and vexation.  Her coming there was\\r\\nthe most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!\\r\\nHow strange it must appear to him!  In what a disgraceful light\\r\\nmight it not strike so vain a man!  It might seem as if she had\\r\\npurposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she\\r\\ncome?  Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?\\r\\nHad they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been\\r\\nbeyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he\\r\\nwas that moment arrived-- that moment alighted from his horse\\r\\nor his carriage.  She blushed again and again over the\\r\\nperverseness of the meeting.  And his behaviour, so strikingly\\r\\naltered-- what could it mean?  That he should even speak to her\\r\\nwas amazing!-- but to speak with such civility, to inquire after\\r\\nher family!  Never in her life had she seen his manners so little\\r\\ndignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this\\r\\nunexpected meeting.  What a contrast did it offer to his last\\r\\naddress in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!\\r\\nShe  knew not what to think, or how to account for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\\r\\nand every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or\\r\\na finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but\\r\\nit was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\\r\\nthough she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of\\r\\nher uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such\\r\\nobjects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the\\r\\nscene.  Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of\\r\\nPemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\r\\nwas.  She longed to know what at the moment was passing in\\r\\nhis mind-- in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in\\r\\ndefiance of everything, she was still dear to him.  Perhaps he\\r\\nhad been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had\\r\\nbeen THAT in his voice which was not like ease.  Whether he\\r\\nhad felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not\\r\\ntell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her\\r\\nabsence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of\\r\\nappearing more like herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\\r\\nwhile, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots\\r\\nwhere the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander,\\r\\nwere many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,\\r\\nwith the long range of woods overspreading many, and\\r\\noccasionally part of the stream.  Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\\r\\nof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a\\r\\nwalk.  With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten\\r\\nmiles round.  It settled the matter; and they pursued the\\r\\naccustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time,\\r\\nin a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water,\\r\\nand one of its narrowest parts.  They crossed it by a simple\\r\\nbridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a\\r\\nspot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley,\\r\\nhere contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\\r\\nand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which\\r\\nbordered it.  Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when\\r\\nthey had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from\\r\\nthe house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go\\r\\nno farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as\\r\\nquickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit,\\r\\nand they took their way towards the house on the opposite side\\r\\nof the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was\\r\\nslow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste,\\r\\nwas very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching\\r\\nthe occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and\\r\\ntalking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.\\r\\nWhilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again\\r\\nsurprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment was quite equal to what\\r\\nit had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them,\\r\\nand at no great distance.  The walk here being here less\\r\\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\r\\nthey met.  Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\\r\\nprepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear\\r\\nand to speak with calmness, if we really intended to meet them.\\r\\nFor a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably\\r\\nstrike into some other path.  The idea lasted while a turning in\\r\\nthe walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he\\r\\nwas immediately before them.  With a glance, she saw that he\\r\\nhad lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\\r\\npoliteness, she began as they to admire the beauty of the place;\\r\\nbut she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and\\r\\n\"charming,\" when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she\\r\\nfancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be\\r\\nmischievously construed.  Her colour changed, and she said no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\\r\\nhe asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him\\r\\nto her friends.  This was a stroke of civility for which she was\\r\\nquite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\\r\\nbeing now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very\\r\\npeople against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to\\r\\nherself.  \"What will be his surprise,\" thought she, \"when he\\r\\nknows who they are?  He takes them now for people of\\r\\nfashion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she\\r\\nnamed their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him,\\r\\nto see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of\\r\\nhis decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful\\r\\ncompanions.  That he was SURPRISED by the connection was\\r\\nevident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from\\r\\ngoing away, turned his back with them, and entered into\\r\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner.  Elizabeth could not but be\\r\\npleased, could not but triumph.  It was consoling that he should\\r\\nknow she had some relations for whom there was no need to\\r\\nblush.  She listened most attentively to all that passed between\\r\\nthem, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her\\r\\nuncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good\\r\\nmanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\r\\nDarcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often\\r\\nas he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering\\r\\nat the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing\\r\\nout those parts of the stream where there was usually most\\r\\nsport.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\\r\\nElizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.  Elizabeth\\r\\nsaid nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\\r\\nmust be all for herself.  Her astonishment, however, was\\r\\nextreme, and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so\\r\\naltered?  From what can it proceed?  It cannot be for ME-- it\\r\\ncannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus softened.  My\\r\\nreproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.  It\\r\\nis impossible that he should still love me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after\\r\\ndescending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of\\r\\nsome curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.\\r\\nIt originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of\\r\\nthe morning, found Elizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support,\\r\\nand consequently preferred her husband\\'s.  Mr. Darcy took her\\r\\nplace by her niece, and they walked on together.  After a short\\r\\nsilence, the lady first spoke.  She wished him to know that she\\r\\nhad been assured of his absence before she came to the place,\\r\\nand accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\r\\nvery unexpected-- \"for your housekeeper,\" she added,\\r\\n\"informed us that you would certainly not be here till\\r\\nto-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we\\r\\nunderstood that you were not immediately expected in the\\r\\ncountry.\"  He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\\r\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a\\r\\nfew hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been\\r\\ntravelling.  \"They will join me early to-morrow ,\" he continued,\\r\\n\"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with\\r\\nyou-- Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow.  Her thoughts were\\r\\ninstantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\'s name had\\r\\nbeen the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge\\r\\nby his complexion, HIS mind was not very differently engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after\\r\\na pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you.\\r\\nWill you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister\\r\\nto your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\\r\\ngreat for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.  She\\r\\nimmediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\\r\\nbeing acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\\r\\nwithout looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to\\r\\nknow that is resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\r\\nElizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\\r\\nflattered and pleased.  His wish of introducing his sister to her\\r\\nwas a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\\r\\nothers, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house-- but she declared\\r\\nherself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.  At such\\r\\na time much might have been said, and silence was very\\r\\nawkward.  She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an\\r\\nembargo on every subject.  At last she recollected that she had\\r\\nbeen travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\\r\\ngreat perseverance.  Yet time and her aunt moved slowly-- and\\r\\nher patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the\\r\\ntete-a-tete was over.  On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s coming up\\r\\nthey were all pressed to go into the house and take some\\r\\nrefreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each\\r\\nside with utmost politeness.  Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into\\r\\nthe carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking\\r\\nslowly towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\\r\\nthem pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\\r\\nhad expected.  \"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\\r\\nunassuming,\" said her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\\r\\naunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.  I can\\r\\nnow say with the housekeeper, that though some people may\\r\\ncall him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.  It was\\r\\nmore than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity\\r\\nfor such attention.  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very\\r\\ntrifling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as\\r\\nWickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for\\r\\nhis features are perfectly good.  But how came you to tell me\\r\\nthat he was so disagreeable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\\r\\nliked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\\r\\nshe had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\"\\r\\nreplied her uncle.  \"Your great men often are; and therefore I\\r\\nshall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\\r\\nanother day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character,\\r\\nbut said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I\\r\\nreally should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\\r\\ncruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.  He\\r\\nhas not an ill-natured look.  On the contrary, there is something\\r\\npleasing about his mouth when he speaks.  And there is\\r\\nsomething of dignity in his countenance that would not give one\\r\\nan unfavourable idea of his heart.  But, to be sure, the good lady\\r\\nwho showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\r\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.  But he is a liberal\\r\\nmaster, I suppose, and THAT in the eye of a servant\\r\\ncomprehends every virtue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\\r\\nvindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave\\r\\nthem to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that\\r\\nby what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions\\r\\nwere capable of a very different construction; and that his\\r\\ncharacter was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\'s so amiable,\\r\\nas they had been considered in Hertfordshire.  In confirmation\\r\\nof this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\r\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually\\r\\nnaming her authority, but stating as such as might be relied on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were\\r\\nnow approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea\\r\\ngave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much\\r\\nengaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots\\r\\nin its environs to think of anything else.  Fatigued as she had\\r\\nbeen by the morning\\'s walk they had no sooner dined than she\\r\\nset off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the\\r\\nevening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed\\r\\nafter many years\\' discontinuance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave\\r\\nElizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she\\r\\ncould do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be\\r\\nacquainted with his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 44\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to\\r\\nvisit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was\\r\\nconsequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole\\r\\nof that morning.  But her conclusion was false; for on the very\\r\\nmorning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.\\r\\nThey had been walking about the place with some of their new\\r\\nfriends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves\\r\\nfor dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage\\r\\ndrew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady\\r\\nin a curricle driving up the street.  Elizabeth immediately\\r\\nrecognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no\\r\\nsmall degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them\\r\\nwith the honour which she expected.  Her uncle and aunt were\\r\\nall amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she\\r\\nspoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the\\r\\ncircumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea\\r\\non the business.  Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they\\r\\nfelt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions\\r\\nfrom such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.\\r\\nWhile these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the\\r\\nperturbation of Elizabeth\\'s feelings was at every moment\\r\\nincreasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but\\r\\namongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality\\r\\nof the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more\\r\\nthan commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that\\r\\nevery power of pleasing would fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\\r\\nwalked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose\\r\\nherself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and\\r\\naunt as made everything worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\\r\\nintroduction took place.  With astonishment did Elizabeth see\\r\\nthat her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as\\r\\nherself.  Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss\\r\\nDarcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few\\r\\nminutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.  She\\r\\nfound it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a\\r\\nmonosyllable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\\r\\nthough little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\\r\\nappearance womanly and graceful.  She was less handsome than\\r\\nher brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face,\\r\\nand her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.\\r\\nElizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and\\r\\nunembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was\\r\\nmuch relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\\r\\nBingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\\r\\nto express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\\r\\nBingley\\'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\\r\\nentered the room.  All Elizabeth\\'s anger against him had been\\r\\nlong done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have\\r\\nstood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\\r\\nexpressed himself on seeing her again.  He inquired in a friendly,\\r\\nthough general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\\r\\nthe same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\\r\\npersonage than to herself.  They had long wished to see him.\\r\\nThe whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.\\r\\nThe suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their\\r\\nniece directed their observation towards each with an earnest\\r\\nthough guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those\\r\\ninquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\\r\\nit was to love.  Of the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little in\\r\\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration\\r\\nwas evident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do.  She wanted to\\r\\nascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to\\r\\ncompose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in\\r\\nthe latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most\\r\\nsure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give\\r\\npleasure were prepossessed in her favour.  Bingley was ready,\\r\\nGeorgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and,\\r\\noh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were\\r\\ndirected in a like manner.  Sometimes she could fancy that he\\r\\ntalked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\\r\\nherself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to\\r\\ntrace a resemblance .  But, though this might be imaginary, she\\r\\ncould not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who\\r\\nhad been set up as a rival to Jane.  No look appeared on either\\r\\nside that spoke particular regard.  Nothing occurred between\\r\\nthem that could justify the hopes of his sister.  On this point she\\r\\nwas soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\\r\\noccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation,\\r\\ndenoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness,\\r\\nand a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her,\\r\\nhad he dared.  He observed to her, at a moment when the others\\r\\nwere talking together, and in a tone which had something of real\\r\\nregret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had the\\r\\npleasure of seeing her\"; and, before she could reply, he added,\\r\\n\"It is above eight months.  We have not met since the 26th of\\r\\nNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\\r\\nafterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by\\r\\nany of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn.\\r\\nThere was not much in the question, nor in the preceding\\r\\nremark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\\r\\nexpression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\\r\\nheard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his\\r\\ncompanions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners\\r\\nwhich she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its\\r\\nexistence might prove, had at least outlived one day.  When she\\r\\nsaw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good\\r\\nopinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago\\r\\nwould have been a disgrace-- when she saw him thus civil, not\\r\\nonly to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly\\r\\ndisdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford\\r\\nParsonage-- the difference, the change was so great, and struck\\r\\nso forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her\\r\\nastonishment from being visible.  Never, even in the company of\\r\\nhis dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\\r\\nRosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\r\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no\\r\\nimportance could result from the success of his endeavours, and\\r\\nwhen even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions\\r\\nwere addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of\\r\\nthe ladies both of Netherfield as Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when\\r\\nthey arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him\\r\\nin expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and\\r\\nMiss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the\\r\\ncountry.  Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked\\r\\nher little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.  Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how SHE,\\r\\nwhom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\r\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.  Presuming\\r\\nhowever, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary\\r\\nembarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her\\r\\nhusband, who was fond or society, a perfect willingness to\\r\\naccept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the\\r\\nday after the next was fixed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\\r\\nElizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many\\r\\ninquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nconstruing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister,\\r\\nwas pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found\\r\\nherself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the\\r\\nlast half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was\\r\\npassing, the enjoyment of it had been little.  Eager to be alone,\\r\\nand fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she\\r\\nstayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable\\r\\nopinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s curiosity;\\r\\nit was not their wish to force her communication.  It was evident\\r\\nthat she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they\\r\\nhad before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in\\r\\nlove with her.  They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify\\r\\ninquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,\\r\\nas far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\r\\nThey could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they\\r\\ndrawn his character from their own feelings and his servant\\'s\\r\\nreport, without any reference to any other account, the circle in\\r\\nHertfordshire to which he was known would not have\\r\\nrecognized it for Mr. Darcy.  There was now an interest,\\r\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became\\r\\nsensible that the authority of a servant who had known him\\r\\nsince he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated\\r\\nrespectability, was not to be hastily rejected.  Neither had\\r\\nanything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends\\r\\nthat could materially lessen its weight.  They had nothing to\\r\\naccuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it\\r\\nwould certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\\r\\nmarket-town where the family did not visit.  It was\\r\\nacknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did\\r\\nmuch good among the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was\\r\\nnot held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his\\r\\nconcerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly\\r\\nunderstood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting\\r\\nDerbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.\\r\\nDarcy afterwards discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening\\r\\nmore than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it\\r\\nseemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings\\r\\ntowards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole\\r\\nhours endeavouring to make them out.  She certainly did not\\r\\nhate him.  No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had\\r\\nalmost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against\\r\\nhim, that could be so called.  The respect created by the\\r\\nconviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly\\r\\nadmitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her\\r\\nfeeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier\\r\\nnature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing\\r\\nforward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday\\r\\nhad produced.  But above all, above respect and esteem, there\\r\\nwas  a motive within her of goodwill which could not be\\r\\noverlooked.  It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having\\r\\nonce loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all\\r\\nthe petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and\\r\\nall the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.  He who,\\r\\nshe had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,\\r\\nseemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the\\r\\nacquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or\\r\\nany peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were\\r\\nconcerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and\\r\\nbent on making her known to his sister.  Such a change in a\\r\\nman of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but\\r\\ngratitude-- for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as\\r\\nsuch its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by\\r\\nno means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.\\r\\nShe respected, she esteemed, he was grateful to him, she felt a\\r\\nreal interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\\r\\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far\\r\\nit would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the\\r\\npower, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing\\r\\non her the renewal of his addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the\\r\\nniece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s in coming to\\r\\nsee them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she\\r\\nhad reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated,\\r\\nthough it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness\\r\\non their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly\\r\\nexpedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.\\r\\nThey were, therefore, to go.  Elizabeth was pleased; though\\r\\nwhen she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in\\r\\nreply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.  The fishing scheme\\r\\nhad been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement\\r\\nmade of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before\\r\\nnoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 45\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\'s dislike of\\r\\nher had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\\r\\nunwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and\\r\\nwas curious to know with how much civility on that lady\\'s side\\r\\nthe acquaintance would now be renewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into\\r\\nthe saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for\\r\\nsummer.  Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most\\r\\nrefreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and\\r\\nof the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were\\r\\nscattered over the intermediate lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was\\r\\nsitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady\\r\\nwith whom she lived in London.  Georgiana\\'s reception of them\\r\\nwas very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which,\\r\\nthough proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong,\\r\\nwould easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief\\r\\nof her being proud and reserved.  Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\\r\\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\\r\\ncurtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\\r\\npauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.  It was\\r\\nfirst broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking\\r\\nwoman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse\\r\\nproved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others;\\r\\nand between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\r\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.  Miss Darcy looked\\r\\nas if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes\\r\\ndid venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its\\r\\nbeing heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\\r\\nBingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\\r\\nDarcy, without calling her attention.  This observation would not\\r\\nhave prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not\\r\\nbeen seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to\\r\\nbe spared the necessity of saying much.  Her own thoughts were\\r\\nemploying her.  She expected every moment that some of the\\r\\ngentlemen would enter the room.  She wished, she feared that\\r\\nthe master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\r\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.\\r\\nAfter sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from\\r\\nher a cold inquiry after the health of her family.  She answered\\r\\nwith equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by\\r\\nthe entrance of the servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety\\r\\nof all the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a\\r\\nvariety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take\\r\\nplace till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.\\r\\nAnnesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her\\r\\npost.  There was now employment for the whole party-- for\\r\\nthough they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\r\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon\\r\\ncollected them round the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\\r\\nwhether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\\r\\nand then, though but a moment before she had believed her\\r\\nwishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or\\r\\nthree other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river,\\r\\nand had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family\\r\\nintended a visit to Georgiana that morning.  No sooner did he\\r\\nappear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and\\r\\nunembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but\\r\\nperhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the\\r\\nsuspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and\\r\\nthat there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his\\r\\nbehaviour when he first came into the room.  In no countenance\\r\\nwas attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nin spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she\\r\\nspoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her\\r\\ndesperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means\\r\\nover.  Miss Darcy, on her brother\\'s entrance, exerted herself\\r\\nmuch more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that she was anxious for\\r\\nhis sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much\\r\\nas possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.  Miss\\r\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger,\\r\\ntook the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from\\r\\nMeryton?  They must be a great loss to YOUR family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name;\\r\\nbut Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in\\r\\nher thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him\\r\\ngave her a moment\\'s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to\\r\\nrepel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question\\r\\nin a tolerably detached tone.  While she spoke, an involuntary\\r\\nglance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,\\r\\nearnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion,\\r\\nand unable to lift up her eyes.  Had Miss Bingley know what\\r\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly\\r\\nwould have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended\\r\\nto discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man\\r\\nto whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility\\r\\nwhich might injure her in Darcy\\'s opinion, and, perhaps, to\\r\\nremind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some\\r\\npart of her family were connected with that corps.  Not a\\r\\nsyllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s meditated\\r\\nelopement.  To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\r\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s\\r\\nconnections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it,\\r\\nfrom the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to\\r\\nhim, of their becoming hereafter her own.  He had certainly\\r\\nformed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect\\r\\nhis endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable\\r\\n that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare\\r\\nof his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\\r\\nemotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared\\r\\nnot approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in\\r\\ntime, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her\\r\\nbrother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her\\r\\ninterest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been\\r\\ndesigned to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\\r\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer\\r\\nabove mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to\\r\\ntheir carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms\\r\\non Elizabeth\\'s person, behaviour, and dress.  But Georgiana\\r\\nwould not join her.  Her brother\\'s recommendation was enough\\r\\nto ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had\\r\\nspoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without\\r\\nthe power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.\\r\\nWhen Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\\r\\n repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\"\\r\\nshe cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\\r\\nis since the winter.  She is grown so brown and coarse!  Louisa\\r\\nand I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\\r\\ncontented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no\\r\\nother alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\\r\\nconsequence of travelling in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never\\r\\ncould see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin; her\\r\\ncomplexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all\\r\\nhandsome.  Her nose wants character-- there is nothing marked\\r\\nin its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common\\r\\nway; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so\\r\\nfine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.  They\\r\\nhave a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her\\r\\nair altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is\\r\\nintolerable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth,\\r\\nthis was not the best method of recommending herself; but\\r\\nangry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look\\r\\nsomewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.  He was\\r\\nresolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making\\r\\nhim speak, she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how\\r\\namazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\\r\\nparticularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\\r\\ndining at Netherfield, \\'SHE a beauty!  I should as soon call her\\r\\nmother a wit.\\'  But afterwards she seemed to improve on you,\\r\\nand I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but\\r\\nTHAT was only when I first saw her, for it is many months\\r\\nsince I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of\\r\\nmy acquaintances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\\r\\nsatisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\\r\\npain but herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned,\\r\\nexcept what had particularly interested them both.  The look and behaviour of everybody they had\\r\\nseen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.  They talked\\r\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit-- of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing\\r\\nto know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified\\r\\nby her niece\\'s beginning the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 46\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival\\r\\nat Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now\\r\\nbeen spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of\\r\\ntwo letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.\\r\\nElizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to\\r\\nenjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.  The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\\r\\nwritten five days ago.  The beginning contained an account of\\r\\nall their little parties and engagements, with such news as the\\r\\ncountry afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day\\r\\nlater, and written in evident agitation, gave more important\\r\\nintelligence.  It was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\\r\\nof a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of\\r\\nalarming you-- be assured that we are all well.  What I have to\\r\\nsay relates to poor Lydia.  An express came at twelve last night,\\r\\n just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to\\r\\ninform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his\\r\\nofficers; to own the truth, with Wickham!  Imagine our surprise.\\r\\nTo Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.  I\\r\\nam very, very sorry.  So imprudent a match on both sides! But I\\r\\nam willing to hope the best, and that his character has been\\r\\nmisunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe\\r\\nhim, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad\\r\\nat heart.  His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know\\r\\nmy father can give her nothing.  Our poor mother is sadly\\r\\ngrieved.  My father bears it better.  How thankful am I that we\\r\\nnever let them know what has been said against him!  we must\\r\\nforget it ourselves.  They were off Saturday night about twelve,\\r\\nas is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\r\\neight.  The express was sent off directly.  My dear Lizzy, they\\r\\nmust have passed within ten miles of us.  Colonel Forster gives\\r\\nus reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his\\r\\nwife, informing her of their intention.  I must conclude, for I\\r\\ncannot be long from my poor mother.  I am afraid you will not\\r\\nbe able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\\r\\nknowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly\\r\\nseized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read\\r\\nas follows:  it had been written a day later than the conclusion of\\r\\nthe first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\\r\\nletter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\\r\\nconfined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\\r\\nfor being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\\r\\nwrite, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\r\\nImprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor\\r\\nLydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken\\r\\nplace, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\r\\nto Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left\\r\\nBrighton the day before, not many hours after the express.\\r\\nThough Lydia\\'s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand\\r\\nthat they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped\\r\\nby Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go\\r\\nthere, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel\\r\\nF., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to\\r\\ntrace their route.  He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no\\r\\nfurther; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\\r\\ncoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\\r\\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue\\r\\nthe London road.  I know not what to think.  After making\\r\\nevery possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on\\r\\ninto Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes,\\r\\nand at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--\\r\\nno such people had been seen to pass through.  With the kindest\\r\\nconcern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\\r\\nto us in a manner most creditable to his heart.  I am sincerely\\r\\ngrieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame\\r\\non them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.  My father\\r\\nand mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.\\r\\nMany circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be\\r\\nmarried privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even\\r\\nif HE could form such a design against a young woman of\\r\\nLydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so\\r\\nlost to everything?  Impossible!  I grieve to find, however, that\\r\\nColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he\\r\\nshook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W.\\r\\nwas not a man to be trusted.  My poor mother is really ill, and\\r\\nkeeps her room.  Could she exert herself, it would be better; but\\r\\nthis is not to be expected.  And as to my father, I never in my\\r\\nlife saw him so affected.  Poor Kitty has anger for having\\r\\nconcealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,\\r\\none cannot wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\\r\\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but\\r\\nnow, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your\\r\\nreturn?  I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\\r\\ninconvenient.  Adieu!  I take up my pen again to do what I\\r\\nhave just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that\\r\\nI cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as\\r\\npossible.  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\r\\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\\r\\nask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel\\r\\nForster instantly, to try to discover her.  What he means to do\\r\\nI am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow\\r\\nhim to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and\\r\\nColonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow\\r\\nevening.  In such and exigence, my uncle\\'s advice and assistance\\r\\nwould be everything in the world; he will immediately\\r\\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from\\r\\nher seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,\\r\\nwithout losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she\\r\\nreached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy\\r\\nappeared.  Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start,\\r\\nand before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose\\r\\nmind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation, hastily\\r\\nexclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.  I must\\r\\nfind Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be\\r\\ndelayed; I have not an instant to loose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling\\r\\nthan politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you\\r\\na minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.  You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she\\r\\nfelt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\r\\nCalling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him,\\r\\nthough in so breathless an accent as made her almost\\r\\nunintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support\\r\\nherself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for\\r\\nDarcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of\\r\\ngentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid.  Is\\r\\nthere nothing you could take to give you present relief?  A\\r\\nglass of wine; shall I get you one?  You are very ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\r\\n \"There is nothing the matter with me.  I am quite well; I am\\r\\nonly distressed by some dreadful news which I have just\\r\\nreceived from Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes\\r\\ncould not speak another word.  Darcy, in wretched suspense,\\r\\ncould only say something indistinctly of his concern, and\\r\\nobserve her in compassionate silence.  At length she spoke\\r\\nagain.  \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful\\r\\nnews. It cannot be concealed from any one.  My younger sister\\r\\nhas left all her friends-- has eloped; has thrown herself into the\\r\\npower of-- of Mr. Wickham.  They are gone off together from\\r\\nBrighton.  YOU know him too well to doubt the rest.  She has\\r\\nno money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to-- she\\r\\nis lost for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.  \"When I consider,\" she added\\r\\nin a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it!\\r\\nI, who knew what he was.  Had I but explained some part of\\r\\nit only-- some part of what I learnt, to my own family!  Had his\\r\\ncharacter been known, this could not have happened.  But it is\\r\\nall-- all too late now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved-- shocked.  But is\\r\\nit certain-- absolutely certain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and\\r\\nwere traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are\\r\\ncertainly not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my\\r\\nuncle\\'s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in\\r\\nhalf-an-hour.  But nothing can be done-- I know very well that\\r\\nnothing can be done.  How is such a man to be worked on?\\r\\nHow are they even to be discovered?  I have not the smallest\\r\\nhope.  It is every way horrible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When MY eyes were opened to his real character-- Oh! had I\\r\\nknown what I ought, what I dared to do!  But I knew not-- I\\r\\nwas afraid of doing too much.  Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and\\r\\nwas walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his\\r\\nbrow contracted, his air gloomy.  Elizabeth soon observed, and\\r\\ninstantly understood it.  Her power was sinking; everything\\r\\nMUST sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an\\r\\nassurance of the deepest disgrace.  She could neither wonder\\r\\nnor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\r\\nto her consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her\\r\\ndistress.  It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her\\r\\nunderstand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt\\r\\nthat she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be\\r\\nvain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.  Lydia--\\r\\nthe humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon\\r\\nswallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her\\r\\nhandkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and,\\r\\nafter a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of\\r\\nher situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner\\r\\nwhich, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint,\\r\\nsaid, \"I am afraid you have been  long desiring my absence, nor\\r\\nhave I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though\\r\\nunavailing concern.  Would to Heaven that anything could be\\r\\neither said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\\r\\nsuch distress!  But I will not torment you with vain wishes,\\r\\nwhich may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.  This\\r\\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\'s having the\\r\\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes.  Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.  Say\\r\\nthat urgent business calls us home immediately.  Conceal the\\r\\nunhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his\\r\\nsorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than\\r\\nthere was at present reason to hope, and leaving his\\r\\ncompliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting\\r\\nlook went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was\\r\\nthat they should ever see each other again on such terms of\\r\\ncordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire;\\r\\nand as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their\\r\\nacquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at\\r\\nthe perverseness of those feelings which would now have\\r\\npromoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in\\r\\nits termination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor\\r\\nfaulty.  But if otherwise-- if regard springing from such sources\\r\\nis unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often\\r\\ndescribed as arising on a first interview with its object, and even\\r\\nbefore two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in\\r\\nher defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the\\r\\nlatter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill\\r\\nsuccess might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less\\r\\ninteresting mode of attachment.  Be that as it may, she saw him\\r\\ngo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy\\r\\nmust produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that\\r\\nwretched business.  Never, since reading Jane\\'s second letter,\\r\\nhad she entertained a hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her.\\r\\nNo one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an\\r\\nexpectation.  Surprise was the least of her feelings on this\\r\\ndevelopment.  While the contents of the first letter remained in\\r\\nher mind, she was all surprise-- all astonishment that Wickham\\r\\nshould marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for\\r\\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had\\r\\nappeared incomprehensible.  But no it was all too natural. For\\r\\nsuch an attachment as this she might have sufficient charm; and\\r\\nthough she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in\\r\\nan elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her\\r\\nunderstanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in\\r\\nHertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was\\r\\nconvinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach\\r\\nherself to anybody.  Sometimes one officer, sometimes another,\\r\\nhad been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her\\r\\nopinion.  Her affections had continually been fluctuating but\\r\\nnever without an object.  The mischief of neglect and mistaken\\r\\nindulgence towards such a girl-- oh! how acutely did she now\\r\\nfeel it!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was wild to be at home-- to hear, to see, to be upon the\\r\\nspot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly\\r\\nupon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother\\r\\nincapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and\\r\\nthough almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia,\\r\\nher uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and\\r\\ntill he entered the room her impatience was severe.  Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the\\r\\nservant\\'s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\\r\\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated\\r\\nthe cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and\\r\\ndwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy,\\r\\nthough Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted.  Not Lydia\\r\\nonly, but all were concerned in it; and after the first\\r\\nexclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised\\r\\nevery assistance in his power.  Elizabeth, though expecting no\\r\\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being\\r\\nactuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was\\r\\nspeedily settled.  They were to be off as soon as possible.  \"But\\r\\nwhat is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it\\r\\nso?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\\r\\nengagement.  THAT is all settled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her\\r\\nroom to prepare.  \"And are they upon such terms as for her to\\r\\ndisclose the real truth?  Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her\\r\\nin the hurry and confusion of the following hour.  Had Elizabeth\\r\\nbeen at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that\\r\\nall employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself;\\r\\nbut she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and\\r\\namongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their\\r\\nfriends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden\\r\\ndeparture.  An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and\\r\\nMr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn,\\r\\nnothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all\\r\\nthe misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of\\r\\ntime than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and\\r\\non the road to Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 47\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle,\\r\\nas they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious\\r\\nconsideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\\r\\nyour eldest sister does on the matter.  It appears to me so very\\r\\nunlikely that any young man should form such a design against\\r\\na girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who\\r\\nwas actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I am strongly\\r\\ninclined to hope the best.  Could he expect that her friends\\r\\nwould not step forward?  Could he expect to be noticed again\\r\\nby the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?  His\\r\\ntemptation is not adequate to the risk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your\\r\\nuncle\\'s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,\\r\\nhonour, and interest, for him to be guilty of.  I cannot think so\\r\\nvery ill of Wickham.  Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give\\r\\nhim up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\r\\nneglect I can believe him capable.  If, indeed, it should be so!\\r\\nBut I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland\\r\\nif that had been the case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute\\r\\nproof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\\r\\nsuch a presumption!  And, besides, no traces of them were to be\\r\\nfound on the Barnet road.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then-- supposing them to be in London.  They may be there,\\r\\nthough for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\\r\\npurpose.  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\\r\\neither side; and it might strike them that they could be more\\r\\neconomically, though less expeditiously, married in London\\r\\nthan in Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why all this secrecy?  Why any fear of detection?  Why must\\r\\ntheir marriage be private?  Oh, no, no-- this is not likely.  His\\r\\nmost particular friend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was\\r\\npersuaded of his never intending to marry her.  Wickham will\\r\\nnever marry a woman without some money.  He cannot afford\\r\\nit.  And what claims has Lydia-- what attraction has she beyond\\r\\nyouth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her\\r\\nsake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying\\r\\nwell?  As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the\\r\\ncorps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am\\r\\nnot able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a\\r\\nstep might produce.  But as to your other objection, I am afraid\\r\\nit will hardly hold good.  Lydia has no brothers to step forward;\\r\\nand he might imagine, from my father\\'s behaviour, from his\\r\\nindolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to\\r\\nwhat was going forward in his family, that HE would do as\\r\\nlittle, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such\\r\\na matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\\r\\nof him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nwith tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and\\r\\nvirtue in such a point should admit of doubt.  But, really, I\\r\\nknow not what to say.  Perhaps I am not doing her justice.  But\\r\\nshe is very young; she has never been taught to think on\\r\\nserious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\\r\\ntwelvemonth-- she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\r\\nand vanity.  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the\\r\\nmost idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that\\r\\ncame in her way.  Since the  ----shire were first quartered in\\r\\nMeryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in\\r\\nher head.  She has been doing everything in her power by\\r\\nthinking and talking on the subject, to give greater-- what shall\\r\\nI call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively\\r\\nenough.  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\\r\\nperson and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very\\r\\nill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?  And who is there, whatever\\r\\nmight be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\\r\\nsuch an attempt, till it were proved against them?  But Jane\\r\\nknows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.  We both know\\r\\nthat he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he\\r\\nhas neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful\\r\\nas he is insinuating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\\r\\ncuriosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring.  \"I told you, the\\r\\nother day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\\r\\nyourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he\\r\\nspoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and\\r\\nliberality towards him.  And there are other circumstances which\\r\\nI am not at liberty-- which it is not worth while to relate; but his\\r\\nlies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what\\r\\nhe said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\r\\nreserved, disagreeable girl.  Yet he knew to the contrary himself.\\r\\nHe must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we\\r\\nhave found her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this?  can she be ignorant of\\r\\nwhat you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and\\r\\nsaw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.  And when I\\r\\nreturned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\\r\\nfortnight\\'s time.  As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I\\r\\nrelated the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\\r\\nknowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\\r\\none, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of\\r\\nhim should then be overthrown?  And even when it was settled\\r\\nthat Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\\r\\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me.  That SHE could\\r\\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head.\\r\\nThat such a consequence as THIS could ensue, you may easily\\r\\nbelieve, was far enough from my thoughts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no\\r\\nreason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the slightest.  I can remember no symptom of affection on\\r\\neither side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\\r\\nmust be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\\r\\nthrown away.  When first he entered the corps, she was ready\\r\\nenough to admire him; but so we all were.  Every girl in or near\\r\\nMeryton was out of her senses about him for the first two\\r\\nmonths; but he never distinguished HER by any particular\\r\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of\\r\\nextravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way,\\r\\nand others of the regiment, who treated her with more\\r\\ndistinction, again became her favourites.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be\\r\\nadded to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting\\r\\nsubject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them\\r\\nfrom it long, during the whole of the journey.  From Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nthoughts it was never absent.  Fixed there by the keenest of all\\r\\nanguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or\\r\\nforgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\\r\\nnight on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next\\r\\nday.  It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could\\r\\nnot have been wearied by long expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\\r\\nstanding on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\\r\\nand, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\\r\\nthat lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole\\r\\nbodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing\\r\\nearnest of their welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\\r\\nkiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\\r\\ndown from her mother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled\\r\\nthe eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything\\r\\nhad been heard of the fugitives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane.  \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I\\r\\nhope everything will be well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have heard only twice.  He wrote me a few lines on\\r\\nWednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me\\r\\nhis directions, which I particularly begged him to do.  He merely\\r\\nadded that he should not write again till he had something of\\r\\nimportance to mention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my mother-- how is she?  How are you all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\\r\\ngreatly shaken.  She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction\\r\\nin seeing you all.  She does not yet leave her dressing-room.\\r\\nMary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you-- how are you?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"You look pale.\\r\\nHow much you must have gone through!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\\r\\ntheir conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were engaged with their children,. Was now put an end\\r\\nto by the approach of the whole party.  Jane ran to her uncle and\\r\\naunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate\\r\\nsmiles and tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\\r\\nElizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\\r\\nothers, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to\\r\\ngive.  The sanguine hope of good, however, which the\\r\\nbenevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;\\r\\nshe still expected that it would all end well, and that every\\r\\nmorning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her\\r\\nfather, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce\\r\\ntheir marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation together, received them exactly as might\\r\\nbe expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\\r\\nagainst the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of\\r\\nher own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the\\r\\nperson to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her\\r\\ndaughter must principally be owing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to\\r\\nBrighton, with all my family, THIS would not have happened;\\r\\nbut poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.  Why did\\r\\nthe Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?  I am sure there\\r\\nwas some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\\r\\nkind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after.\\r\\nI always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her;\\r\\nbut I was overruled, as I always am.  Poor dear child!  And now\\r\\nhere\\'s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\r\\nWickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\\r\\nwhat is to become of us all?  The Collinses will turn us out\\r\\nbefore he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\\r\\nbrother, I do not know what we shall do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\nafter general assurances of his affection for her and all her\\r\\nfamily, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\\r\\nand would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\\r\\nLydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is\\r\\nright to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look\\r\\non it a certain.  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\\r\\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we\\r\\nknow that they are not married, and have no design of marrying,\\r\\ndo not let us give the matter over as lost.  As soon as I get to\\r\\ntown I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with\\r\\nme to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as\\r\\nto what is to be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly\\r\\nwhat I could most wish for.  And now do, when you get to\\r\\ntown, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not\\r\\nmarried already, MAKE them marry.  And as for wedding\\r\\nclothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall\\r\\nhave as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they\\r\\nare married.  And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\\r\\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out\\r\\nof my wits-- and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all\\r\\nover me-- such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and\\r\\nsuch beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.\\r\\nAnd tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her\\r\\nclothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are\\r\\nthe best warehouses.  Oh, brother, how kind you are!  I know\\r\\nyou will contrive it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\\r\\nendeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending\\r\\nmoderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after\\r\\ntalking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they\\r\\nall left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who\\r\\nattended in the absence of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\\r\\nreal occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\\r\\nattempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\\r\\nenough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they\\r\\nwaited at table, and judged it better that ONE only of the\\r\\nhousehold, and the one whom they could most trust should\\r\\ncomprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty,\\r\\nwho had been  too busily engaged in their separate apartments\\r\\nto make their appearance before.  One came from her books,\\r\\nand the other from her toilette.  The faces of both, however,\\r\\nwere tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except\\r\\nthat the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had\\r\\nherself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness\\r\\nthan usual to the accents of Kitty.  As for Mary, she was\\r\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a\\r\\ncountenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\\r\\ntable:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\\r\\ntalked of.  But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into\\r\\nthe wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly\\r\\nconsolation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\\r\\nadded, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw\\r\\nfrom it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\\r\\nirretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\\r\\nthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that\\r\\nshe cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\\r\\nundeserving of the other sex.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\\r\\noppressed to make any reply.  Mary, however, continued to\\r\\nconsole herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil\\r\\nbefore them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\r\\nhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\\r\\nherself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane\\r\\nwas equally eager to satisfy.  After joining in general\\r\\nlamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\\r\\nElizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\\r\\nnot assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\\r\\nsubject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which\\r\\nI have not already heard.  Give me further particulars.  What did\\r\\nColonel Forster say?  Had they no apprehension of anything\\r\\nbefore the elopement took place?  They must have seen them\\r\\ntogether for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\\r\\npartiality, especially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any\\r\\nalarm.  I am so grieved for him!  His behaviour was attentive and\\r\\nkind to the utmost.  He WAS coming to us, in order to assure us\\r\\nof his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to\\r\\nScotland:  when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\\r\\nhis journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?\\r\\nDid he know of their intending to go off?  Had Colonel Forster\\r\\nseen Denny himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied knowing\\r\\nanything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\\r\\nabout it.  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\\r\\nmarrying-- and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might\\r\\nhave been misunderstood before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\\r\\nentertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?\\r\\nI felt a little uneasy-- a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with\\r\\nhim in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been\\r\\nalways quite right.  My father and mother knew nothing of that;\\r\\nthey only felt how imprudent a match it must be.  Kitty then\\r\\nowned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the\\r\\nrest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter she had prepared her for\\r\\nsuch a step.  She had known, it seems, of their being in love with\\r\\neach other, many weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham\\r\\nhimself?  Does he know he real character?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\\r\\nformerly did.  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\r\\nAnd since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left\\r\\nMeryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew\\r\\nof him, this could not have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister.  \"But to\\r\\nexpose the former faults of any person without knowing what\\r\\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.  We acted with\\r\\nthe best intentions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to\\r\\nhis wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\r\\nThese were the contents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,--\\r\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot\\r\\nhelp laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as\\r\\nsoon as I am missed.  I am going to Gretna Green, and if you\\r\\ncannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there\\r\\nis but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.  I should\\r\\nnever be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.  You\\r\\nneed not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do\\r\\nnot like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write\\r\\nto them and sign my name \\'Lydia Wickham.\\'  What a good joke\\r\\nit will be!  I can hardly write for laughing.  Pray make my\\r\\nexcuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing\\r\\nwith him to-night.  Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he\\r\\nknows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we\\r\\nmeet, with great pleasure.  I shall send for my clothes when I\\r\\nget to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a\\r\\ngreat slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.\\r\\nGood-bye.  Give my love to Colonel Forster.  I hope you will\\r\\ndrink to our good journey.  Your affectionate friend,\\r\\n                              \"Lydia Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she\\r\\nhad finished it.  What a letter is this, to be written at such a\\r\\nmoment!  But at least it shows that SHE was serious on the\\r\\nsubject of their journey.  Whatever he might afterwards\\r\\npersuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of\\r\\ninfamy.  My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI never saw any one so shocked.  He could not speak a word\\r\\nfor full ten minutes.  My mother was taken ill immediately, and\\r\\nthe whole house in such confusion!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it\\r\\nwho did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  I hope there was.  But to be guarded at such a\\r\\ntime is very difficult.  My mother was in hysterics, and though I\\r\\nendeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am\\r\\nafraid I did not do so much as I might have done!  But the\\r\\nhorror of what might possibly happen almost took from me\\r\\nmy faculties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.  You do\\r\\nnot look well.  Oh that I had been with you!  you have had every\\r\\ncare and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\\r\\nevery fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of\\r\\nthem.  Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\\r\\nthat her hours of repose should not be broken in on.  My aunt\\r\\nPhillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went\\r\\naway; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.  She\\r\\nwas of great use and comfort to us all.  And Lady Lucas has\\r\\nbeen very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\r\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her\\r\\ndaughters\\', if they should be of use to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps\\r\\nshe MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\\r\\ncannot see too little of one\\'s neighbours.  Assistance is\\r\\nimpossible; condolence insufferable.  Let them triumph over us\\r\\nat a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her\\r\\nfather had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of\\r\\nhis daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place\\r\\nwhere they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\\r\\nanything could be made out from them.  His principal object\\r\\nmust be to discover the number of the hackney coach which\\r\\ntook them from Clapham.  It had come with a fare from\\r\\nLondon; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\\r\\ngentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another\\r\\nmight be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.  If\\r\\nhe could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had\\r\\nbefore set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there,\\r\\nand hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and\\r\\nnumber of the coach.  I do not know of any other designs that\\r\\nhe had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his\\r\\nspirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\r\\nout even so much as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 48\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\\r\\nnext morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\\r\\nfrom him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions,\\r\\na most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\\r\\nthey had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that\\r\\nhe had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of THAT they\\r\\nwould have been glad to be certain.  Mr. Gardiner had waited\\r\\nonly for the letters before he set off.\\r\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\\r\\nconstant information of what was going on, and their uncle\\r\\npromised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\\r\\nLongbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\\r\\nsister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\'s\\r\\nnot being killed in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire\\r\\na few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\\r\\nserviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\\r\\nfreedom.  Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\\r\\nalways, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\\r\\nthem up-- though, as she never came without reporting some\\r\\nfresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity, she\\r\\nseldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than\\r\\nshe found them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\\r\\nmonths before, had been almost an angel of light.  He was\\r\\ndeclared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his\\r\\nintrigues all honoured with the title of seduction, had been\\r\\nextended into every tradesman\\'s family.  Everybody declared\\r\\nthat he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\\r\\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted\\r\\nthe appearance of his goodness.  Elizabeth, though she did not\\r\\ncredit above half of what was said, believed enough to make\\r\\nher former assurance of her sister\\'s ruin more certain; and even\\r\\nJane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more\\r\\nespecially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to\\r\\nScotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they\\r\\nmust in all probability have gained some news of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\\r\\nreceived a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he\\r\\nhad immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to\\r\\ncome to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to\\r\\nEpsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining\\r\\nany satisfactory information; and that he was now determined\\r\\nto inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\r\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on\\r\\ntheir first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.\\r\\nMr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this\\r\\nmeasure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist\\r\\nhim in pursuing it.  He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly\\r\\ndisinclined at present to leave London and promised to write\\r\\nagain very soon.  There was also a postscript to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\r\\npossible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the\\r\\nregiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections\\r\\nwho would be likely to know in what part of town he has now\\r\\nconcealed himself.  If there were any one that one could apply\\r\\nto with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be\\r\\nof essential consequence.  At present we have nothing to guide\\r\\nus.  Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power\\r\\nto satisfy us on this head.  But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\\r\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than\\r\\nany other person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this\\r\\ndeference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her\\r\\npower to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the\\r\\ncompliment deserved.  She had never heard of his having had\\r\\nany relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had\\r\\nbeen dead many years.  It was possible, however, that some of\\r\\nhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more\\r\\ninformation; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\\r\\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\\r\\nanxious part of each was when the post was expected.  The\\r\\narrival of letters was the grand object of every morning\\'s\\r\\nimpatience.  Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be\\r\\ntold would be communicated, and every succeeding day was\\r\\nexpected to bring some news of importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\\r\\nfor their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\\r\\nwhich, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\\r\\nhim in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who\\r\\nknew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her,\\r\\nand read it likewise. It was s follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--\\r\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in\\r\\nlife, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\r\\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\\r\\nfrom Hertfordshire.  Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins\\r\\nand myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your\\r\\nrespectable family, in your present distress, which must be of\\r\\nthe bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no\\r\\n time can remove.  No arguments shall be wanting on my part\\r\\nthat can alleviate so severe a misfortune-- or that may comfort\\r\\nyou, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most\\r\\nafflicting to a parent\\'s mind.  The death of your daughter would\\r\\nhave been a blessing in comparison of  this.  And it is the more\\r\\nto be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear\\r\\nCharlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in\\r\\nyour daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;\\r\\nthough, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition\\r\\nmust be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an\\r\\nenormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are\\r\\ngrievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by\\r\\nMrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter,\\r\\nto whom I have related the affair.  They agree with me in\\r\\napprehending that this false step in one daughter will be\\r\\ninjurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\\r\\nwith such a family?  And this consideration leads me moreover\\r\\nto reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last\\r\\nNovember; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\\r\\nin all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me then advise you, dear\\r\\nsir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your\\r\\nunworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\\r\\nreap the fruits of her own heinous offense.-- I am, dear sir, etc.,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\\r\\nfrom Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\\r\\nnature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single\\r\\nrelationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was\\r\\ncertain that he had no  near one living.  His former\\r\\nacquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the\\r\\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular\\r\\nfriendship with any of them.  There was no one, therefore, who\\r\\ncould be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And in\\r\\nthe wretched state of his own finances, there was a very\\r\\npowerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery\\r\\nby Lydia\\'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left\\r\\ngaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\\r\\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.  He owed\\r\\na good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\\r\\nformidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these\\r\\nparticulars from the Longbourn family.  Jane heard them with\\r\\nhorror.  \"A gamester!\" she cried.  \"This is wholly unexpected.\\r\\nI had not an idea of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\\r\\ntheir father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\r\\nRendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he\\r\\nhad yielded to his brother-in-law\\'s entreaty that he would return\\r\\nto his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might\\r\\nsuggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.  When Mrs.\\r\\nBennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction\\r\\nas her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his\\r\\nlife had been before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she cried.\\r\\n\"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.  Who\\r\\nis to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes\\r\\naway?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled\\r\\nthat she and the children should go to London, at the same time\\r\\nthat Mr. Bennet came from it.  The coach, therefore, took them\\r\\nthe first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to\\r\\nLongbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth\\r\\nand her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part\\r\\nof the world.  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned\\r\\nbefore them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter\\r\\nfrom him, had ended in nothing.  Elizabeth had received none\\r\\nsince her return that could come from Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other\\r\\nexcuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,\\r\\ntherefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though\\r\\nElizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with\\r\\nher own feelings, was perfectly  aware that, had she known\\r\\nnothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia\\'s\\r\\ninfamy somewhat better.  It would have spared her, she thought,\\r\\none sleepless night out of two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\r\\nphilosophic composure.  He said as little as he had ever been in\\r\\nthe habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\\r\\ntaken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\\r\\ncourage to speak of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\\r\\nthat Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\\r\\nher briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have\\r\\nendured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that.  Who should suffer\\r\\nbut myself?  It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil.  Human nature is\\r\\nso prone to fall into it!  No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel\\r\\nhow much I have been to blame.  I am not afraid of being\\r\\noverpowered by the impression.  It will pass away soon enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her residence\\r\\nthere will probably be of some duration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen after a short silence he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to\\r\\nme last May, which, considering the event, shows some\\r\\ngreatness of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\\r\\nmother\\'s tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives such\\r\\nan elegance to misfortune!  Another day I will do the same; I\\r\\nwill sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and\\r\\ngive as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till\\r\\nKitty runs away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully.  \"If I\\r\\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU go to Brighton.  I would not trust you so near it as\\r\\nEastbourne for fifty pounds!  No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\\r\\nbe cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.  No officer is ever\\r\\nto enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\\r\\nvillage.  Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\\r\\nwith one of your sisters.  And you are never to stir out of doors\\r\\ntill you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\\r\\nin a rational manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy.  If you\\r\\nare a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\\r\\nat the end of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 49\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\\r\\nwalking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw\\r\\nthe housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she\\r\\ncame to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her;\\r\\nbut, instead of the expected summons, when they approached\\r\\nher, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon, madam, for\\r\\ninterrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\r\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Hill?  We have heard nothing from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t\\r\\nyou know there is an express come for master from Mr.\\r\\nGardiner?  He has been here this half-hour, and master has had\\r\\na letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\r\\nThey ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\\r\\nthence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were\\r\\non the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when\\r\\nthey were met by the butler, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking\\r\\ntowards the little copse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\\r\\nonce more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\\r\\ndeliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side\\r\\nof the paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running\\r\\nas Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\\r\\nbreath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa, what news-- what news?  Have you heard from my\\r\\nuncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring-- good or bad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the\\r\\nletter from his pocket.  \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.  Jane now came\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what\\r\\nit is about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                    \"Gracechurch Street, Monday,\"\\r\\n                              \"August 2.\\r\\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,--\\r\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and\\r\\nsuch as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.\\r\\nSoon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to\\r\\nfind out in what part of London they were.  The particulars I\\r\\nreserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.\\r\\nI have seen them both-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth read on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen them both.  They are not married, nor can I find\\r\\nthere was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\\r\\nperform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\\r\\nyour side, I hope it will not be long before they are.  All that is\\r\\nrequired of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\\r\\nequal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\\r\\nchildren after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\r\\nmoreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\\r\\nyour life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\r\\nwhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\\r\\nwith, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.  I shall send\\r\\nthis by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your\\r\\nanswer.  You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\\r\\nthat Mr. Wickham\\'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they\\r\\nare generally believed to be.  The world has been deceived in\\r\\nthat respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little\\r\\nmoney, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my\\r\\nniece, in addition to her own fortune.  If, as I conclude will be\\r\\nthe case, you send me full powers to act in your name\\r\\nthroughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give\\r\\ndirections to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.\\r\\nThere will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town\\r\\nagain; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my\\r\\ndiligence and care.  Send back your answer as fast as you can,\\r\\nand be careful to write explicitly.  We have judged it best that\\r\\nmy niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\\r\\nyou will approve.  She comes to us to-day.  I shall write again as\\r\\nsoon as anything more is determined on.  Yours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"EDW. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.  \"Can it\\r\\nbe possible that he will marry her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\" said\\r\\nher sister.  \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time\\r\\nbefore he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write\\r\\nimmediately.  Consider how important every moment is in such\\r\\na case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards\\r\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I suppose,\\r\\nmust be complied with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Complied with!  I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they MUST marry!  Yet he is SUCH a man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry.  There is nothing else to be done.\\r\\nBut there are two things that I want very much to know; one is,\\r\\nhow much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about;\\r\\nand the other, how am I ever to pay him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Money!  My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so\\r\\nslight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and\\r\\nfifty after I am gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred\\r\\nto me before.  His debts to be discharged, and something still to\\r\\nremain!  Oh! it must be my uncle\\'s doings!  Generous, good\\r\\nman, I am afraid he has distressed himself.  A small sum could\\r\\nnot do all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham\\'s a fool if he takes her with a\\r\\nfarthing less than ten thousand pounds.  I should be sorry to\\r\\nthink so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten thousand pounds!  Heaven forbid!  How is half such a\\r\\nsum to be repaid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\\r\\ncontinued silent till they reached the house.  Their father then\\r\\nwent on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\\r\\nbreakfast-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon\\r\\nas they were by themselves.  \"How strange this is!  And for\\r\\nTHIS we are to be thankful.  That they should marry, small as\\r\\nis their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character,\\r\\nwe are forced to rejoice.  Oh, Lydia!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly\\r\\nwould not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.\\r\\nThough our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\\r\\nhim, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\\r\\nit, has been advanced.  He has children of his own, and may\\r\\nhave more.  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been,\"\\r\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our\\r\\nsister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\\r\\nthem, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.  The\\r\\nkindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.  Their\\r\\ntaking her home, and affording her their personal protection and\\r\\ncountenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of\\r\\ngratitude cannot enough acknowledge.  By this time she is\\r\\nactually with them!  If such goodness does not make her\\r\\nmiserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!  What a\\r\\nmeeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\"\\r\\nsaid Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.  His\\r\\nconsenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come\\r\\nto a right way of thinking.  Their mutual affection will steady\\r\\nthem; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in\\r\\nso rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence\\r\\nforgotten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither\\r\\nyou, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.  It is useless to talk of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\\r\\nlikelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.  They went\\r\\nto the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would\\r\\nnot wish them to make it known to her.  He was writing and,\\r\\nwithout raising his head, coolly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\\r\\nupstairs together.  Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\\r\\none communication would, therefore, do for all.  After a slight\\r\\npreparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet could hardly contain herself.  As soon as Jane had read\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s  being soon married, her joy\\r\\nburst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\r\\nexuberance.  She was now in an irritation as violent from\\r\\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.\\r\\nTo know that her daughter would be married was enough.  She\\r\\nwas disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any\\r\\nremembrance of her misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried.  \"This is delightful indeed!\\r\\nShe will be married!  I shall see her again!  She will be married at\\r\\nsixteen!  My good, kind brother!  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nknew he would manage everything!  How I long to see her!  and\\r\\nto see dear Wickham too!  But the clothes, the wedding clothes!\\r\\nI will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.  Lizzy,\\r\\nmy dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will\\r\\ngive her.  Stay, stay, I will go myself.  Ring the bell, Kitty, for\\r\\nHill.  I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia!\\r\\nHow merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\\r\\nviolence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\\r\\nobligations which Mr. Gardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a\\r\\ngreat measure to his kindness.  We are persuaded that he has\\r\\npledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it\\r\\nbut her own uncle?  If he had not had a family of his own, I and\\r\\nmy children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\\r\\nfirst time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\\r\\npresents.  Well!  I am so happy!  In a short time I shall have a\\r\\ndaughter married.  Mrs. Wickham!  How well it sounds!  And\\r\\nshe was only sixteen last June.  My dear Jane, I am in such a\\r\\nflutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and you\\r\\nwrite for me.  We will settle with your father about the money\\r\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,\\r\\nand cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very\\r\\nplentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty,\\r\\npersuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be\\r\\nconsulted.  One day\\'s delay, she observed, would be of small\\r\\nimportance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so\\r\\nobstinate as usual.  Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and\\r\\ntell the good, good news to my sister Philips.  And as I come\\r\\nback, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.  Kitty, run down\\r\\nand order the carriage.  An airing would do me a great deal of\\r\\ngood, I am sure.  Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?\\r\\nOh!  Here comes Hill!  My dear Hill, have you heard the good\\r\\nnews?  Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have\\r\\na bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.  Elizabeth received\\r\\nher congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly,\\r\\ntook refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it\\r\\nwas no worse, she had need to be thankful.  She felt it so; and\\r\\nthough, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\\r\\nworldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\\r\\nlooking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\\r\\nfelt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 50\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\\r\\nthat, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\\r\\nannual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\\r\\nwife, if she survived him.  He now wished it more than ever.\\r\\nHad he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\\r\\nindebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could\\r\\nnow be purchased for her.  The satisfaction of prevailing on one\\r\\nof the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her\\r\\nhusband might then have rested in its proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\\r\\nanyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\\r\\nbrother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\\r\\nthe extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\\r\\nsoon as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\\r\\nperfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.  The\\r\\nson was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be\\r\\nof age, and the widow and younger children would by that\\r\\nmeans be provided for.  Five daughters successively entered the\\r\\nworld, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many\\r\\nyears after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he would.  This\\r\\nevent had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\\r\\nsaving.  Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\\r\\nhusband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their\\r\\nexceeding their income.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet and the children.  But in what proportions it should be\\r\\ndivided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\r\\nThis was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was\\r\\nnow to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\\r\\nacceding to the proposal before him.  In terms of grateful\\r\\nacknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\\r\\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\r\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\r\\nengagements that had been made for him.  He had never before\\r\\nsupposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\\r\\ndaughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\\r\\nhimself as by the present arrangement.  He would scarcely be\\r\\nten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid\\r\\nthem; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the\\r\\ncontinual presents in money which passed to her through her\\r\\nmother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expenses had been very little within\\r\\nthat sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\\r\\ntoo, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\\r\\nwas to have as little trouble in the business as possible.  When\\r\\nthe first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\\r\\nseeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\\r\\nindolence.  His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\\r\\nin undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.  He\\r\\nbegged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to\\r\\nhis brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message\\r\\nto her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with\\r\\nproportionate speed through the neighbourhood.  It was borne\\r\\nin the latter with decent philosophy.  To be sure, it would have\\r\\nbeen more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia\\r\\nBennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,\\r\\nbeen secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse.  But\\r\\nthere was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\\r\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded\\r\\nbefore from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little\\r\\nof their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such\\r\\nan husband her misery was considered certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\\r\\nthis happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\\r\\nand in spirits oppressively high.  No sentiment of shame gave a\\r\\ndamp to her triumph.  The marriage of a daughter, which had\\r\\nbeen the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was\\r\\nnow on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her\\r\\nwords ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine\\r\\nmuslins, new carriages, and servants.  She was busily searching\\r\\nthrough the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her\\r\\ndaughter, and, without knowing of considering what their\\r\\nincome might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--\\r\\nor the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;\\r\\nbut Ashworth is too far off!  I could not bear to have her ten\\r\\nmiles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while\\r\\nthe servants remained.  But when they had withdrawn, he said\\r\\nto her: \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses\\r\\nfor your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.\\r\\nInto ONE house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\\r\\nadmittance.  I will not encourage the impudence of either, by\\r\\nreceiving them at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\\r\\nfirm.  It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\\r\\namazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a\\r\\nguinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she\\r\\nshould receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the\\r\\noccasion.  Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.  That his\\r\\nanger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\r\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which\\r\\nher marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could\\r\\nbelieve possible.  She was more alive to the disgrace which her\\r\\nwant of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than\\r\\nto any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a\\r\\nfortnight before they took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\\r\\ndistress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\\r\\nwith their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would\\r\\nso shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they\\r\\nmight hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those\\r\\nwho were not immediately on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\\r\\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more\\r\\nconfidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one\\r\\nwhose knowledge of a sister\\'s frailty would have mortified her\\r\\nso much-- not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it\\r\\nindividually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf\\r\\nimpassable between them.  Had Lydia\\'s marriage been\\r\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be\\r\\nsupposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family\\r\\nwhere, to every other objection, would now be added an\\r\\nalliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom\\r\\nhe so justly scorned.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would\\r\\nshrink.  The wish of procuring her regard, which she had\\r\\nassured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational\\r\\nexpectation survive such a blow as this.  She was humbled, she\\r\\nwas grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.\\r\\nShe became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer\\r\\nhope to be benefited by it.  She wanted to hear of him, when\\r\\nthere seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.  She was\\r\\nconvinced that she could have been happy with him, when it\\r\\nwas no longer likely they should meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know\\r\\nthat the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four\\r\\nmonths ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully\\r\\nreceived!  He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most\\r\\ngenerous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a\\r\\ntriumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man\\r\\nwho, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have\\r\\nanswered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to\\r\\nthe advantage of both: by her ease and liveliness, his mind might\\r\\nhave been softened, his manners improved; and from his\\r\\njudgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\\r\\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring\\r\\nmultitude what connubial felicity really was.  An union of a\\r\\ndifferent tendency ,and precluding the possibility of the other,\\r\\nwas soon to be formed in their family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\\r\\nindependence, she could not imagine.  But how little of\\r\\npermanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only\\r\\nbrought together because their passions were stronger than their\\r\\nvirtue, she could easily conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.  To Mr. Bennet\\'s\\r\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\\r\\neagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\\r\\nconcluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\\r\\nmentioned to him again.  The principal purport of his letter was\\r\\nto inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\\r\\nmilitia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as\\r\\nsoon as his marriage was fixed on.  And I think you will agree\\r\\nwith me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly\\r\\nadvisable, both on his account and my niece\\'s.  It is Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s intention to go into the regulars; and among his\\r\\nformer friends, there are still some who are able and willing to\\r\\nassist him in the army.  He has the promise of an ensigncy in\\r\\nGeneral ----\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North.  It is an\\r\\nadvantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.  He\\r\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they\\r\\nmay each have a character to preserve, they will both be more\\r\\nprudent.  I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our\\r\\npresent arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the\\r\\nvarious creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with\\r\\nassurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.\\r\\nAnd will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar\\r\\nassurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a\\r\\nlist according to his information?  He has given in all his debts; I\\r\\nhope at least he has not deceived us.  Haggerston has our\\r\\ndirections, and all will be completed in a week.  They will then\\r\\njoin his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and\\r\\nI understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous\\r\\nof seeing you all before she leaves the South.  She is well, and\\r\\nbegs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.--\\r\\nYours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"E. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of\\r\\nWickham\\'s removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr.\\r\\nGardiner could do.  But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased\\r\\nwith it.  Lydia\\'s being settled in the North, just when she had\\r\\nexpected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had\\r\\nby no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nwas a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity\\r\\nthat Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was\\r\\nacquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster, \"said she, \"it will be quite\\r\\nshocking to send her away!  And there are several of the young\\r\\nmen, too, that she likes very much.  The officers may not be so\\r\\npleasant in General ----\\'s regiment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\r\\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\r\\nreceived at first an absolute negative.  But Jane and Elizabeth,\\r\\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and\\r\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her\\r\\nparents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly,\\r\\nto receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they\\r\\nwere married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought,\\r\\nand act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction\\r\\nof knowing that she would be able to show her married\\r\\ndaughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\\r\\nNorth.  When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,\\r\\nhe sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that\\r\\nas soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to\\r\\nLongbourn.  Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham\\r\\nshould consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only\\r\\nher own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the\\r\\nlast object of her wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 51\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEIR sister\\'s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\\r\\nfor her probably more than she felt for herself.  The carriage\\r\\nwas sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by\\r\\ndinner-time.  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss\\r\\nBennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings\\r\\nwhich would have attended herself, had she been the culprit,\\r\\nand was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came.  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\\r\\nreceive them.  Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\\r\\ncarriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\\r\\ngrave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\\r\\nopen, and she ran into the room.  Her mother stepped forwards,\\r\\nembraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand,\\r\\nwith an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady;\\r\\nand wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt\\r\\nof their happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned,\\r\\nwas not quite so cordial.  His countenance rather gained in\\r\\nausterity; and he scarcely opened his lips.  The easy\\r\\nassurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke\\r\\nhim.  Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was\\r\\nshocked.  Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild,\\r\\nnoisy, and fearless.  She turned from sister to sister,\\r\\ndemanding their congratulations; and when at length they all\\r\\nsat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some\\r\\nlittle alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it\\r\\nwas a great while since she had been there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\\r\\nmanners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\\r\\nmarriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\\r\\naddress, while he claimed their relationship, would have\\r\\ndelighted them all.  Elizabeth had not before believed him\\r\\nquite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving\\r\\nwithin herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of\\r\\nan impudent man.  She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\\r\\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no\\r\\nvariation of colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no want of discourse.  The bride and her mother could\\r\\nneither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\\r\\nsit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in\\r\\nthat neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt\\r\\nvery unable to equal in her replies.  They seemed each of them\\r\\nto have the happiest memories in the world.  Nothing of the\\r\\npast was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to\\r\\nsubjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I\\r\\nwent away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there\\r\\nhave been things enough happened in the time.  Good gracious!\\r\\nwhen I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married\\r\\ntill I came back again!  though I thought it would be very good\\r\\nfun if I was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father lifted up his eyes.  Jane was distressed.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlooked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\\r\\nany thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\\r\\n\"Oh!  mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married\\r\\nto-day?  I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William\\r\\nGoulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know\\r\\nit, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off\\r\\nmy glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so\\r\\nthat he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\\r\\nany thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer.  She got up, and ran out of\\r\\nthe room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing\\r\\nthrough the hall to the dining parlour.  She then joined them\\r\\nsoon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her\\r\\nmother\\'s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,\\r\\n\"Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower,\\r\\nbecause I am a married woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\\r\\nembarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\r\\nHer ease and good spirits increased.  She longed to see Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\\r\\nhear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\" by each of them; and in the\\r\\nmean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring, and boast of\\r\\nbeing married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the\\r\\nbreakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband?  Is not\\r\\nhe a charming man?  I am sure my sisters must all envy me.  I\\r\\nonly hope they may have half my good luck.  They must all go to\\r\\nBrighton.  That is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it\\r\\nis, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But my dear\\r\\nLydia, I don\\'t at all like your going such a way off.  Must it\\r\\nbe so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  yes; -- there is nothing in that.  I shall like it\\r\\nof all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must come down\\r\\nand see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I\\r\\ndare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get\\r\\ngood partners for them all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\\r\\nsisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for\\r\\nthem before the winter is over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.\\r\\nMr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London,\\r\\nand he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\\r\\nshort; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\\r\\nher daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These\\r\\nparties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was\\r\\neven more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\\r\\nexpected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him.  She had\\r\\nscarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from\\r\\nthe reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on\\r\\nby the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would\\r\\nhave wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose\\r\\nto elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his\\r\\nflight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\r\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an\\r\\nopportunity of having a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him.  He was her dear Wickham on\\r\\nevery occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.\\r\\nHe did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would\\r\\nkill more birds on the first of September, than any body else\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\\r\\nher two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe.\\r\\nYou were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\r\\nAre not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too\\r\\nlittle said on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!  You are so strange!  But I must tell you how it went off.\\r\\nWe were married, you know, at St. Clement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s\\r\\nlodgings were in that parish.  And it was settled that we\\r\\nshould all be there by eleven o\\'clock.  My uncle and aunt and I\\r\\nwere to go together; and the others were to meet us at the\\r\\nchurch.  Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!\\r\\nI was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put\\r\\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.  And\\r\\nthere was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and\\r\\ntalking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However, I\\r\\ndid not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may\\r\\nsuppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed to know whether he would\\r\\nbe married in his blue coat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it\\r\\nwould never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,\\r\\nthat my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I\\r\\nwas with them.  If you\\'ll believe me, I did not once put my\\r\\nfoot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.  Not one\\r\\nparty, or scheme, or any thing.  To be sure London was rather\\r\\nthin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  Well, and so\\r\\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away\\r\\nupon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  And then, you\\r\\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it.\\r\\nWell, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my\\r\\nuncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we\\r\\ncould not be married all day.  But, luckily, he came back again\\r\\nin ten minutes\\' time, and then we all set out.  However, I\\r\\nrecollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going,\\r\\nthe wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done\\r\\nas well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! -- he was to come there with Wickham, you know, But\\r\\ngracious me!  I quite forgot!  I ought not to have said a word\\r\\nabout it.  I promised them so faithfully!  What will Wickham\\r\\nsay?  It was to be such a secret!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on\\r\\nthe subject.  You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with\\r\\ncuriosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly\\r\\ntell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it\\r\\nout of her power, by running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\\r\\nleast it was impossible not to try for information.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad been at her sister\\'s wedding.  It was exactly a scene, and\\r\\nexactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and\\r\\nleast temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it,\\r\\nrapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied\\r\\nwith none.  Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct\\r\\nin the noblest light, seemed most improbable.  She could not\\r\\nbear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote\\r\\na short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\r\\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which\\r\\nhad been intended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity\\r\\nmust be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\\r\\n(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\\r\\nbeen amongst you at such a time.  Pray write instantly, and let\\r\\nme understand it -- unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to\\r\\nremain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and\\r\\nthen I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not that I shall, though,\" she added to herself, as she\\r\\nfinished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me\\r\\nin an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks\\r\\nand stratagems to find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\r\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\\r\\nglad of it; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would\\r\\nreceive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a\\r\\nconfidante.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 52\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\\r\\nletter as soon as she possibly could.  She was no sooner in\\r\\npossession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where\\r\\nshe was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of\\r\\nthe benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the\\r\\nletter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR NIECE,\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\r\\nmorning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing\\r\\nwill not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must confess\\r\\nmyself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from\\r\\nyou.  Don\\'t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let\\r\\nyou know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary\\r\\non your side.  If you do not choose to understand me, forgive\\r\\nmy impertinence.  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am --\\r\\nand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\\r\\nwould have allowed him to act as he has done.  But if you are\\r\\nreally innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.  On the\\r\\nvery day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a\\r\\nmost unexpected visitor.  Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up\\r\\nwith him several hours.  It was all over before I arrived; so\\r\\nmy curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your\\'s seems to\\r\\nhave been.  He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out\\r\\nwhere your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen\\r\\nand talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\\r\\nFrom what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\\r\\nourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\r\\nthem.  The motive professed was his conviction of its being\\r\\nowing to himself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so\\r\\nwell known as to make it impossible for any young woman of\\r\\ncharacter to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed the\\r\\nwhole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before\\r\\nthought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the\\r\\nworld.  His character was to speak for itself.  He called it,\\r\\ntherefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an\\r\\nevil which had been brought on by himself.  If he had\\r\\nanother motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.  He\\r\\nhad been some days in town, before he was able to discover\\r\\nthem; but he had something to direct his search, which was more\\r\\nthan we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason\\r\\nfor his resolving to follow us.  There is a lady, it seems, a\\r\\nMrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and\\r\\nwas dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation,\\r\\nthough he did not say what.  She then took a large house in\\r\\nEdward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\\r\\nlodgings.  This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted\\r\\nwith Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as\\r\\nsoon as he got to town.  But it was two or three days before he\\r\\ncould get from her what he wanted.  She would not betray her\\r\\ntrust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she\\r\\nreally did know where her friend was to be found.  Wickham\\r\\nindeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and\\r\\nhad she been able to receive them into her house, they would\\r\\nhave taken up their abode with her.  At length, however, our\\r\\nkind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They were in\\r\\n---- street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing\\r\\nLydia.  His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to\\r\\npersuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and\\r\\nreturn to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to\\r\\nreceive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.\\r\\nBut he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she\\r\\nwas.  She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of\\r\\nhis; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.  She was sure they\\r\\nshould be married some time or other, and it did not much\\r\\nsignify when.  Since such were her feelings, it only remained,\\r\\nhe thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his\\r\\nvery first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had\\r\\nnever been his design.  He confessed himself obliged to leave\\r\\nthe regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were\\r\\nvery pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences\\r\\nof Lydia\\'s flight on her own folly alone.  He meant to resign\\r\\nhis commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he\\r\\ncould conjecture very little about it.  He must go somewhere,\\r\\nbut he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing\\r\\nto live on.  Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\\r\\nsister at once.  Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very\\r\\nrich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his\\r\\nsituation must have been benefited by marriage.  But he found,\\r\\nin reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the\\r\\nhope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some\\r\\nother country.  Under such circumstances, however, he was not\\r\\nlikely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\r\\nThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\r\\nWickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\\r\\nwas reduced to be reasonable.  Every thing being settled\\r\\nbetween them, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to make your uncle\\r\\nacquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street\\r\\nthe evening before I came home.  But Mr. Gardiner could not be\\r\\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father\\r\\nwas still with him, but would quit town the next morning.  He\\r\\ndid not judge your father to be a person whom he could so\\r\\nproperly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\\r\\nseeing him till after the departure of the former.  He did not\\r\\nleave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a\\r\\ngentleman had called on business.  On Saturday he came again.\\r\\nYour father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said\\r\\nbefore, they had a great deal of talk together.  They met again\\r\\non Sunday, and then I saw him too.  It was not all settled\\r\\nbefore Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\\r\\nLongbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.  I fancy,\\r\\nLizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\r\\nafter all.  He has been accused of many faults at different\\r\\ntimes, but this is the true one.  Nothing was to be done that\\r\\nhe did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it\\r\\nto be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle\\r\\nwould most readily have settled the whole.  They battled it\\r\\ntogether for a long time, which was more than either the\\r\\ngentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.  But at last your\\r\\nuncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be\\r\\nof use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the\\r\\nprobable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and\\r\\nI really believe your letter this morning gave him great\\r\\npleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him\\r\\nof his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\r\\nBut, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at\\r\\nmost.  You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for\\r\\nthe young people.  His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\\r\\nbelieve, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\\r\\nthousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his\\r\\ncommission purchased.  The reason why all this was to be done\\r\\nby him alone, was such as I have given above.  It was owing to\\r\\nhim, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\\r\\nWickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently\\r\\nthat he had been received and noticed as he was.  Perhaps there\\r\\nwas some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve,\\r\\nor anybody\\'s reserve, can be answerable for the event.  But\\r\\nin spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest\\r\\nperfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if\\r\\nwe had not given him credit for another interest in the\\r\\naffair.  When all this was resolved on, he returned again to\\r\\nhis friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was\\r\\nagreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding\\r\\ntook place, and all money matters were then to receive the last\\r\\nfinish.  I believe I have now told you every thing.  It is a\\r\\nrelation which you tell me is to give you great surprise;\\r\\nI hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.\\r\\nLydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the\\r\\nhouse.  He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in\\r\\nHertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\\r\\nsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I\\r\\nhad not perceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her\\r\\nconduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and\\r\\ntherefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.\\r\\nI talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\\r\\nrepresenting to her all the wickedness of what she had done,\\r\\nand all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.  If she\\r\\nheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not\\r\\nlisten.  I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected\\r\\nmy dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience\\r\\nwith her.  Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia\\r\\ninformed you, attended the wedding.  He dined with us the next\\r\\nday, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.\\r\\nWill you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this\\r\\nopportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say\\r\\nbefore) how much I like him.  His behaviour to us has, in every\\r\\nrespect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\\r\\na little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently,\\r\\nhis wife may teach him.  I thought him very sly; -- he hardly\\r\\never mentioned your name.  But slyness seems the fashion.  Pray\\r\\nforgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\\r\\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P.  I shall never be\\r\\nquite happy till I have been all round the park.  A low\\r\\nphaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very\\r\\nthing.  But I must write no more.  The children have been\\r\\nwanting me this half hour.  Your\\'s, very sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\nM. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter\\r\\nof spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether\\r\\npleasure or pain bore the greatest share.  The vague and\\r\\nunsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what\\r\\nMr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s match,\\r\\nwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness\\r\\ntoo great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\\r\\njust, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their\\r\\ngreatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to\\r\\ntown, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification\\r\\nattendant on such a research; in which supplication had been\\r\\nnecessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and\\r\\nwhere he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,\\r\\npersuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished\\r\\nto avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\\r\\npronounce.  He had done all this for a girl whom he could\\r\\nneither regard nor esteem.  Her heart did whisper that he had\\r\\ndone it for her.  But it was a hope shortly checked by other\\r\\nconsiderations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was\\r\\ninsufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her\\r\\n-- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to\\r\\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against\\r\\nrelationship with Wickham.  Brother-in-law of Wickham!  Every\\r\\nkind of pride must revolt from the connection.  He had, to be\\r\\nsure, done much.  She was ashamed to think how much.  But he\\r\\nhad given a reason for his interference, which asked no\\r\\nextraordinary stretch of belief.  It was reasonable that he\\r\\nshould feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had\\r\\nthe means of exercising it; and though she would not place\\r\\nherself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps,\\r\\nbelieve that remaining partiality for her might assist his\\r\\nendeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\\r\\nmaterially concerned.  It was painful, exceedingly painful, to\\r\\nknow that they were under obligations to a person who could\\r\\nnever receive a return.  They owed the restoration of Lydia,\\r\\nher character, every thing, to him.  Oh!  how heartily did she\\r\\ngrieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,\\r\\nevery saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.  For\\r\\nherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.  Proud that\\r\\nin a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\\r\\nthe better of himself.  She read over her aunt\\'s commendation\\r\\nof him again and again.  It was hardly enough; but it pleased\\r\\nher.  She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with\\r\\nregret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had\\r\\nbeen persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between\\r\\nMr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some\\r\\none\\'s approach; and before she could strike into another path,\\r\\nshe was overtaken by Wickham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\"\\r\\nsaid he, as he joined her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not\\r\\nfollow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.  We were always good\\r\\nfriends; and now we are better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  Are the others coming out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the\\r\\ncarriage to Meryton.  And so, my dear sister, I find, from\\r\\nour uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would\\r\\nbe too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to\\r\\nNewcastle.  And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?  Poor\\r\\nReynolds, she was always very fond of me.  But of course she\\r\\ndid not mention my name to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\\r\\n-- not turned out well.  At such a distance as that, you\\r\\nknow, things are strangely misrepresented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips.  Elizabeth hoped she\\r\\nhad silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.  We passed\\r\\neach other several times.  I wonder what he can be doing\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"It must be something particular, to take him there\\r\\nat this time of year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly.  Did you see him while you were at Lambton?\\r\\nI thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\\r\\nthis year or two.  When I last saw her, she was not very\\r\\npromising.  I am very glad you liked her.  I hope she will turn\\r\\nout well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\\r\\nhad.  A most delightful place! -- Excellent Parsonage House!\\r\\nIt would have suited me in every respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceedingly well.  I should have considered it as part of my\\r\\nduty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.  One ought\\r\\nnot to repine; -- but, to be sure, it would have been such a\\r\\nthing for me!  The quiet, the retirement of such a life would\\r\\nhave answered all my ideas of happiness!  But it was not to be.\\r\\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were\\r\\nin Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good,\\r\\nthat it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\\r\\npresent patron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have.  Yes, there was something in that; I told you so\\r\\nfrom the first, you may remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making\\r\\nwas not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that\\r\\nyou actually declared your resolution of never taking orders,\\r\\nand that the business had been compromised accordingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did!  and it was not wholly without foundation.  You may\\r\\nremember what I told you on that point, when first we talked\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she\\r\\nhad walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her\\r\\nsister\\'s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with\\r\\na good-humoured smile,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.\\r\\nDo not let us quarrel about the past.  In future, I hope we\\r\\nshall be always of one mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate\\r\\ngallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they\\r\\nentered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 53\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation\\r\\nthat he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear\\r\\nsister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was\\r\\npleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwas forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by\\r\\nno means entered into her scheme of their all going to\\r\\nNewcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  I don\\'t know.  Not these two or three years,\\r\\nperhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As often as I can.  But you know married women have never much\\r\\ntime for writing.  My sisters may write to me.  They will\\r\\nhave nothing else to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his\\r\\nwife\\'s.  He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were\\r\\nout of the house, \"as ever I saw.  He simpers, and smirks, and\\r\\nmakes love to us all.  I am prodigiously proud of him.  I defy\\r\\neven Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable\\r\\nson-in-law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for\\r\\nseveral days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as\\r\\nparting with one\\'s friends.  One seems so forlorn without\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying\\r\\na daughter,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It must make you better\\r\\nsatisfied that your other four are single.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no such thing.  Lydia does not leave me because she is\\r\\nmarried, but only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be\\r\\nso far off.  If that had been nearer, she would not have gone\\r\\nso soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into\\r\\nwas shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the\\r\\nagitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be\\r\\nin circulation.  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received\\r\\norders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming\\r\\ndown in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.  She looked at Jane, and\\r\\nsmiled and shook her head by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\"\\r\\n(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news).  \"Well, so\\r\\nmuch the better.  Not that I care about it, though.  He is\\r\\nnothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to\\r\\nsee him again.  But, however, he is very welcome to come to\\r\\nNetherfield, if he likes it.  And who knows what may\\r\\nhappen?  But that is nothing to us.  You know, sister, we\\r\\nagreed long ago never to mention a word about it.  And so,\\r\\nis it quite certain he is coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls\\r\\nwas in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out\\r\\nmyself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that\\r\\nit was certain true.  He comes down on Thursday at the latest,\\r\\nvery likely on Wednesday.  She was going to the butcher\\'s, she\\r\\ntold me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she\\r\\nhas got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without\\r\\nchanging colour.  It was many months since she had mentioned\\r\\nhis name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone\\r\\ntogether, she said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of\\r\\nthe present report; and I know I appeared distressed.  But\\r\\ndon\\'t imagine it was from any silly cause.  I was only confused\\r\\nfor the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at.\\r\\nI do assure you that the news does not affect me either with\\r\\npleasure or pain.  I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone;\\r\\nbecause we shall see the less of him.  Not that I am afraid of\\r\\nmyself, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it.  Had she not seen\\r\\nhim in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of\\r\\ncoming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but\\r\\nshe still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to\\r\\nthe greater probability of his coming there with his friend\\'s\\r\\npermission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man\\r\\ncannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without\\r\\nraising all this speculation!  I will leave him to himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be\\r\\nher feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could\\r\\neasily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.  They\\r\\nwere more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\\r\\nparents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"you will wait on him of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no.  You forced me into visiting him last year, and\\r\\npromised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my\\r\\ndaughters.  But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on\\r\\na fool\\'s errand again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an\\r\\nattention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he.  \"If he wants our\\r\\nsociety, let him seek it.  He knows where we live.  I will not\\r\\nspend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they\\r\\ngo away and come back again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do\\r\\nnot wait on him.  But, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking\\r\\nhim to dine here, I am determined.  We must have Mrs. Long and\\r\\nthe Gouldings soon.  That will make thirteen with ourselves, so\\r\\nthere will be just room at table for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear\\r\\nher husband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know\\r\\nthat her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence\\r\\nof it, before they did.  As the day of his arrival drew near,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her\\r\\nsister.  \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\\r\\nindifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\\r\\ntalked of.  My mother means well; but she does not know, no one\\r\\ncan know, how much I suffer from what she says.  Happy shall I\\r\\nbe, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power.  You must feel\\r\\nit; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a\\r\\nsufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley arrived.  Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of\\r\\nservants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that\\r\\nthe period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as\\r\\nlong as it could.  She counted the days that must intervene\\r\\nbefore their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him\\r\\nbefore.  But on the third morning after his arrival in\\r\\nHertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\\r\\nenter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.  Jane\\r\\nresolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to\\r\\nsatisfy her mother, went to the window -- she looked, -- she\\r\\nsaw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it\\r\\nbe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I\\r\\ndo not know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to\\r\\nbe with him before.  Mr. what\\'s-his-name.  That tall, proud\\r\\nman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Mr. Darcy! -- and so it does, I vow.  Well,\\r\\nany friend of Mr. Bingley\\'s will always be welcome here, to be\\r\\nsure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.  She knew\\r\\nbut little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt\\r\\nfor the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him\\r\\nalmost for the first time after receiving his explanatory\\r\\nletter.  Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.  Each felt for\\r\\nthe other, and of course for themselves; and their mother\\r\\ntalked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to\\r\\nbe civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\\'s friend, without being\\r\\nheard by either of them.  But Elizabeth had sources of\\r\\nuneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she\\r\\nhad never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\\'s letter, or to\\r\\nrelate her own change of sentiment towards him.  To Jane, he\\r\\ncould be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose\\r\\nmerit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\r\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were\\r\\nindebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded\\r\\nherself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as\\r\\nreasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.  Her\\r\\nastonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield, to\\r\\nLongbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal\\r\\nto what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour\\r\\nin Derbyshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for\\r\\nhalf a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight\\r\\nadded lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time\\r\\nthat his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.  But she\\r\\nwould not be secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be\\r\\nearly enough for expectation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without\\r\\ndaring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them\\r\\nto the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the\\r\\ndoor.  Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate\\r\\nthan Elizabeth had expected.  On the gentlemen\\'s appearing, her\\r\\ncolour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease,\\r\\nand with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom\\r\\nof resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and\\r\\nsat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\\r\\noften command.  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.  He\\r\\nlooked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been\\r\\nused to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at\\r\\nPemberley.  But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s presence\\r\\nbe what he was before her uncle and aunt.  It was a painful,\\r\\nbut not an improbable, conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that\\r\\nshort period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.  He\\r\\nwas received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which\\r\\nmade her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with\\r\\nthe cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address\\r\\nto his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the\\r\\nlatter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\\r\\nirremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\\r\\ndegree by a distinction so ill applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a\\r\\nquestion which she could not answer without confusion, said\\r\\nscarcely any thing.  He was not seated by her; perhaps that was\\r\\nthe reason of his silence; but it had not been so in\\r\\nDerbyshire.  There he had talked to her friends, when he could\\r\\nnot to herself.  But now several minutes elapsed without\\r\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable\\r\\nto resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his\\r\\nface, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and\\r\\nfrequently on no object but the ground.  More thoughtfulness\\r\\nand less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were\\r\\nplainly expressed.  She was disappointed, and angry with\\r\\nherself for being so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she.  \"Yet why did\\r\\nhe come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself;\\r\\nand to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.  \"I began to be afraid you would never come back\\r\\nagain.  People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;\\r\\nbut, however, I hope it is not true.  A great many changes have\\r\\nhappened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.  Miss Lucas\\r\\nis married and settled.  And one of my own daughters.\\r\\nI suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen\\r\\nit in the papers.  It was in The Times and The Courier, I\\r\\nknow; though it was not put in as it ought to be.  It was only\\r\\nsaid, ``Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\'\\'\\r\\nwithout there being a syllable said of her father, or the place\\r\\nwhere she lived, or any thing.  It was my brother Gardiner\\'s\\r\\ndrawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an\\r\\nawkward business of it.  Did you see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\r\\nElizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.  How Mr. Darcy looked,\\r\\ntherefore, she could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter\\r\\nwell married,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time,\\r\\nMr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from\\r\\nme.  They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward,\\r\\nit seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long.\\r\\nHis regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his\\r\\nleaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.\\r\\nThank Heaven!  he has some friends, though perhaps not so\\r\\nmany as he deserves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was\\r\\nin such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\\r\\nIt drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which\\r\\nnothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked\\r\\nBingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at\\r\\npresent.  A few weeks, he believed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\"\\r\\nsaid her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as\\r\\nmany as you please on Mr. Bennet\\'s manor.  I am sure he\\r\\nwill be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the\\r\\nbest of the covies for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such\\r\\nofficious attention!  Were the same fair prospect to arise at\\r\\npresent as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was\\r\\npersuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.\\r\\nAt that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not\\r\\nmake Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful\\r\\nconfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never\\r\\nmore to be in company with either of them.  Their society can\\r\\nafford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as\\r\\nthis!  Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\r\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from\\r\\nobserving how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the\\r\\nadmiration of her former lover.  When first he came in, he had\\r\\nspoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be\\r\\ngiving her more of his attention.  He found her as handsome as\\r\\nshe had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,\\r\\nthough not quite so chatty.  Jane was anxious that no\\r\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really\\r\\npersuaded that she talked as much as ever.  But her mind was\\r\\nso busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\\r\\nher intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to\\r\\ndine at Longbourn in a few days time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added,\\r\\n\"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take\\r\\na family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.  I have not\\r\\nforgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed\\r\\nthat you did not come back and keep your engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\\r\\nsomething of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\r\\nThey then went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and\\r\\ndine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good\\r\\ntable, she did not think any thing less than two courses could\\r\\nbe good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs,\\r\\nor satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 54\\r\\n\\r\\nAS soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover\\r\\nher spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption\\r\\non those subjects that must deaden them more.  Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nbehaviour astonished and vexed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\"\\r\\nsaid she, \"did he come at all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and\\r\\naunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?  If he fears me,\\r\\nwhy come hither?  If he no longer cares for me, why silent?\\r\\nTeazing, teazing, man!  I will think no more about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by\\r\\nthe approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful\\r\\nlook, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors,\\r\\nthan Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel\\r\\nperfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never be\\r\\nembarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines here on\\r\\nTuesday.  It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides,\\r\\nwe meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly.\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much\\r\\nin love with you as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the\\r\\nhappy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness\\r\\nof Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had revived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn;\\r\\nand the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of\\r\\ntheir punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.  When\\r\\nthey repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to\\r\\nsee whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their\\r\\nformer parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.  Her\\r\\nprudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite\\r\\nhim to sit by herself.  On entering the room, he seemed to\\r\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to\\r\\nsmile: it was decided.  He placed himself by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\\r\\nfriend.  He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\\r\\nimagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,\\r\\nhad she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nwith an expression of half-laughing alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\\r\\nshewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\\r\\nformerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\\r\\nJane\\'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.\\r\\nThough she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet\\r\\nreceived pleasure from observing his behaviour.  It gave her\\r\\nall the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\r\\nno cheerful humour.  Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as\\r\\nthe table could divide them.  He was on one side of her mother.\\r\\nShe knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to\\r\\neither, or make either appear to advantage.  She was not near\\r\\nenough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how\\r\\nseldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was\\r\\ntheir manner whenever they did.  Her mother\\'s ungraciousness,\\r\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind; and she would, at times, have given any\\r\\nthing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was\\r\\nneither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\\r\\nof bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would\\r\\nnot pass away without enabling them to enter into something\\r\\nmore of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation\\r\\nattending his entrance.  Anxious and uneasy, the period which\\r\\npassed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was\\r\\nwearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\\r\\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\\r\\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he does not come to me, then,\" said she, \"I shall give\\r\\nhim up for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would\\r\\nhave answered her hopes; but, alas!  the ladies had crowded\\r\\nround the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and\\r\\nElizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy\\r\\nthat there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit\\r\\nof a chair.  And on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of the\\r\\ngirls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined.  We want\\r\\nnone of them; do we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room.  She\\r\\nfollowed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke,\\r\\nhad scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and\\r\\nthen was enraged against herself for being so silly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who has once been refused!  How could I ever be foolish\\r\\nenough to expect a renewal of his love?  Is there one among the\\r\\nsex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\\r\\nproposal to the same woman?  There is no indignity so abhorrent\\r\\nto their feelings!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\\r\\ncoffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone on to\\r\\nScarborough, these three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\\r\\nconverse with her, he might have better success.  He stood by\\r\\nher, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on\\r\\nthe young lady\\'s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed,\\r\\nthe ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon\\r\\njoined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him\\r\\nfall a victim to her mother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and\\r\\nin a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.  She\\r\\nnow lost every expectation of pleasure.  They were confined for\\r\\nthe evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope,\\r\\nbut that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the\\r\\nroom, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen\\r\\nto supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any\\r\\nof the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to\\r\\nthemselves, \"What say you to the day?  I think every thing has\\r\\npassed off uncommonly well, I assure you.  The dinner was as\\r\\nwell dressed as any I ever saw.  The venison was roasted to a\\r\\nturn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.  The\\r\\nsoup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases\\'\\r\\nlast week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\\r\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three\\r\\nFrench cooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look\\r\\nin greater beauty.  Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her\\r\\nwhether you did not.  And what do you think she said besides?\\r\\n``Ah!  Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\\'\\'\\r\\nShe did indeed.  I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as\\r\\never lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and\\r\\nnot at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\\r\\nenough of Bingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\\r\\nwould get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\\r\\nfamily, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\\r\\nshe was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the\\r\\nnext day, to make his proposals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable\\r\\none with the other.  I hope we may often meet again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect me.  It\\r\\nmortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy\\r\\nhis conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man,\\r\\nwithout having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly satisfied,\\r\\nfrom what his manners now are, that he never had any design\\r\\nof engaging my affection.  It is only that he is blessed\\r\\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of\\r\\ngenerally pleasing, than any other man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me\\r\\nsmile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\r\\nacknowledge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.  We all\\r\\nlove to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\\r\\nknowing.  Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do\\r\\nnot make me your confidante.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 55\\r\\n\\r\\nA FEW days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and\\r\\nalone.  His friend had left him that morning for London, but\\r\\nwas to return home in ten days time.  He sat with them above an\\r\\nhour, and was in remarkably good spirits.  Mrs. Bennet invited\\r\\nhim to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern,\\r\\nhe confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more\\r\\nlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if\\r\\nshe would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of\\r\\nwaiting on them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her\\r\\ninvitation was accepted with alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none\\r\\nof them dressed.  In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\'s room, in\\r\\nher dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.  He is come --\\r\\nMr. Bingley is come. -- He is, indeed.  Make haste, make haste.\\r\\nHere, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on\\r\\nwith her gown.  Never mind Miss Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say\\r\\nKitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs\\r\\nhalf an hour ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  hang Kitty!  what has she to do with it?  Come be quick,\\r\\nbe quick!  Where is your sash, my dear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\\r\\ngo down without one of her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again\\r\\nin the evening.  After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library,\\r\\nas was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.\\r\\nTwo obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a\\r\\nconsiderable time, without making any impression on them.\\r\\nElizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did,\\r\\nshe very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma?  What do\\r\\nyou keep winking at me for?  What am I to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing child, nothing.  I did not wink at you.\"  She then sat\\r\\nstill five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious\\r\\noccasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here,\\r\\nmy love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room.\\r\\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her\\r\\ndistress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she\\r\\nwould not give in to it.  In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nhalf-opened the door and called out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her\\r\\nmother, as soon as she was in the hall.  \"Kitty and I are going\\r\\nup stairs to sit in my dressing room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but\\r\\nremained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of\\r\\nsight, then returned into the drawing room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley\\r\\nwas every thing that was charming, except the professed lover\\r\\nof her daughter.  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a\\r\\nmost agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore\\r\\nwith the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all\\r\\nher silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance\\r\\nparticularly grateful to the daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he\\r\\nwent away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own\\r\\nand Mrs. Bennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot\\r\\nwith her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.\\r\\nNot a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but\\r\\nElizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must\\r\\nspeedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the\\r\\nstated time.  Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded\\r\\nthat all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s\\r\\nconcurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\\r\\nspent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter\\r\\nwas much more agreeable than his companion expected.  There was\\r\\nnothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke\\r\\nhis ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more\\r\\ncommunicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen\\r\\nhim.  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the\\r\\nevening Mrs. Bennet\\'s invention was again at work to get every\\r\\nbody away from him and her daughter.  Elizabeth, who had a\\r\\nletter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose\\r\\nsoon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to\\r\\ncards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\'s\\r\\nschemes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was\\r\\nfinished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was\\r\\nreason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for\\r\\nher.  On opening the door, she perceived her sister and\\r\\nBingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\\r\\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the\\r\\nfaces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away\\r\\nfrom each other, would have told it all.  Their situation\\r\\nwas awkward enough; but her\\'s she thought was still worse.\\r\\nNot a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on\\r\\nthe point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as\\r\\nthe other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\\r\\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence\\r\\nwould give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,\\r\\nwith the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature\\r\\nin the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much.  I do not\\r\\ndeserve it.  Oh!  why is not every body as happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\\r\\nwarmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.  Every\\r\\nsentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.\\r\\nBut she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say\\r\\nhalf that remained to be said for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried.  \"I would not on\\r\\nany account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow\\r\\nher to hear it from any one but myself.  He is gone to my\\r\\nfather already.  Oh!  Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate\\r\\nwill give such pleasure to all my dear family!  how shall I\\r\\nbear so much happiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken\\r\\nup the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity\\r\\nand ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had\\r\\ngiven them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious\\r\\ncircumspection!  of all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance!\\r\\nthe happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference\\r\\nwith her father had been short and to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With my mother up stairs.  She will be down in a moment,\\r\\nI dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\\r\\nwishes and affection of a sister.  Elizabeth honestly and\\r\\nheartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their\\r\\nrelationship.  They shook hands with great cordiality; and\\r\\nthen, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he\\r\\nhad to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections;\\r\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed\\r\\nall his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded,\\r\\nbecause they had for basis the excellent understanding, and\\r\\nsuper-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity\\r\\nof feeling and taste between her and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the\\r\\nsatisfaction of Miss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet\\r\\nanimation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\r\\nKitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation\\r\\nin terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked\\r\\nto Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr.\\r\\nBennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly\\r\\nshewed how really happy he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till\\r\\ntheir visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone, he turned to his daughter, and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you.  You will be a very happy woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\r\\ngoodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure\\r\\nin thinking you will be so happily settled.  I have not a doubt\\r\\nof your doing very well together.  Your tempers are by no means\\r\\nunlike.  You are each of you so complying, that nothing will\\r\\never be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat\\r\\nyou; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not so.  Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\\r\\nwould be unpardonable in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceed their income!  My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife,\\r\\n\"what are you talking of?  Why, he has four or five thousand a\\r\\nyear, and very likely more.\"  Then addressing her daughter,\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!  I am sure I shan\\'t\\r\\nget a wink of sleep all night.  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nalways said it must be so, at last.  I was sure you could not\\r\\nbe so beautiful for nothing!  I remember, as soon as ever I saw\\r\\nhim, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought\\r\\nhow likely it was that you should come together.  Oh!  he is\\r\\nthe handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.  Jane was beyond\\r\\ncompetition her favourite child.  At that moment, she cared\\r\\nfor no other.  Her younger sisters soon began to make interest\\r\\nwith her for objects of happiness which she might in future be\\r\\nable to dispense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and\\r\\nKitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\\r\\nLongbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\\r\\nremaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\\r\\nneighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him\\r\\nan invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to\\r\\naccept.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\\r\\nsister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to\\r\\nbestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably\\r\\nuseful to both of them in those hours of separation that must\\r\\nsometimes occur.  In the absence of Jane, he always attached\\r\\nhimself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and\\r\\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means\\r\\nof relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling\\r\\nme that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last\\r\\nspring!  I had not believed it possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But how did he\\r\\naccount for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing.  They were certainly no\\r\\nfriends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,\\r\\nsince he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many\\r\\nrespects.  But when they see, as I trust they will, that their\\r\\nbrother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and\\r\\nwe shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we\\r\\nonce were to each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that\\r\\nI ever heard you utter.  Good girl!  It would vex me, indeed,\\r\\nto see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last\\r\\nNovember, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of\\r\\nmy being indifferent would have prevented his coming down\\r\\nagain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit\\r\\nof his modesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\\r\\ndiffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\\r\\nqualities.  Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not\\r\\nbetrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had\\r\\nthe most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew\\r\\nit was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\"\\r\\ncried Jane.  \"Oh!  Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family,\\r\\nand blessed above them all!  If I could but see you as happy!\\r\\nIf there were but such another man for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so\\r\\nhappy as you.  Till I have your disposition, your goodness,\\r\\nI never can have your happiness.  No, no, let me shift for\\r\\nmyself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet\\r\\nwith another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be\\r\\nlong a secret.  Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to\\r\\nMrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do\\r\\nthe same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family\\r\\nin the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had\\r\\nfirst run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out\\r\\nfor misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 56\\r\\n\\r\\nONE morning, about a week after Bingley\\'s engagement with\\r\\nJane had been formed, as he and the females of the family\\r\\nwere sitting together in the dining room, their attention\\r\\nwas suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage;\\r\\nand they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.\\r\\nIt was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\\r\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\\r\\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery\\r\\nof the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.  As it\\r\\nwas certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley\\r\\ninstantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of\\r\\nsuch an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.\\r\\nThey both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\\r\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was\\r\\nthrown open and their visitor entered.  It was Lady Catherine\\r\\nde Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\r\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to\\r\\nthem, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\\r\\nmade no other reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation than a slight\\r\\ninclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\r\\nElizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her\\r\\nladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of introduction had been\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a\\r\\nguest of such high importance, received her with the utmost\\r\\npoliteness.  After sitting for a moment in silence, she said\\r\\nvery stiffly to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.  That lady, I suppose,\\r\\nis your mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  \"She is my youngest girl but one.  My youngest of\\r\\nall is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the\\r\\ngrounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon\\r\\nbecome a part of the family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine\\r\\nafter a short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;\\r\\nbut I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\\r\\nin summer; the windows are full west.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\\r\\nand then added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you\\r\\nleft Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for\\r\\nher from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for\\r\\nher calling.  But no letter appeared, and she was completely\\r\\npuzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\\r\\nsome refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\\r\\nvery politely, declined eating any thing; and then, rising up,\\r\\nsaid to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\\r\\nwilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be glad to take\\r\\na turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about\\r\\nthe different walks.  I think she will be pleased with the\\r\\nhermitage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her\\r\\nparasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.  As they passed\\r\\nthrough the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the\\r\\ndining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a\\r\\nshort survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\r\\nwaiting-woman was in it.  They proceeded in silence along the\\r\\ngravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\\r\\nmake no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\\r\\nthan usually insolent and disagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she\\r\\nlooked in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\\r\\nfollowing manner: --\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason\\r\\nof my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own conscience,\\r\\nmust tell you why I come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been at all able\\r\\nto account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you\\r\\nought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.  But however\\r\\ninsincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.\\r\\nMy character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and\\r\\nfrankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not depart from it.  A report of a most alarming\\r\\nnature reached me two days ago.  I was told that not only your\\r\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\\r\\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all\\r\\nlikelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own\\r\\nnephew, Mr. Darcy.  Though I know it must be a scandalous\\r\\nfalsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\\r\\nthe truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off\\r\\nfor this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\ncolouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the\\r\\ntrouble of coming so far.  What could your ladyship propose by\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally\\r\\ncontradicted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\\r\\nindeed, such a report is in existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If!  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has it not\\r\\nbeen industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do you not know\\r\\nthat such a report is spread abroad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation\\r\\nfor it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your\\r\\nladyship.  You may ask questions which I shall not\\r\\nchoose to answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is not to be borne.  Miss Bennet, I insist on being\\r\\nsatisfied.  Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\\r\\nhis reason.  But your arts and allurements may, in a moment\\r\\nof infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself\\r\\nand to all his family.  You may have drawn him in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?  I have not been accustomed\\r\\nto such language as this.  I am almost the nearest relation he\\r\\nhas in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest\\r\\nconcerns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such\\r\\nbehaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me be rightly understood.  This match, to which you have\\r\\nthe presumption to aspire, can never take place.  No, never.\\r\\nMr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.  Now what have you to\\r\\nsay?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\\r\\nhe will make an offer to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.  From their\\r\\ninfancy, they have been intended for each other.  It was the\\r\\nfavourite wish of his mother, as well as of her\\'s.  While in\\r\\ntheir cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment\\r\\nwhen the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\\r\\nmarriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,\\r\\nof no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the\\r\\nfamily!  Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\\r\\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?  Are you lost to\\r\\nevery feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard\\r\\nme say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his\\r\\ncousin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that to me?  If\\r\\nthere is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and\\r\\naunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.  You both did as much\\r\\nas you could in planning the marriage.  Its completion depended\\r\\non others.  If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\\r\\nconfined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?\\r\\nAnd if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\r\\nYes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed\\r\\nby his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\\r\\ninclinations of all.  You will be censured, slighted, and\\r\\ndespised, by every one connected with him.  Your alliance will\\r\\nbe a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any\\r\\nof us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But the\\r\\nwife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of\\r\\nhappiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she\\r\\ncould, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl!  I am ashamed of you!  Is this\\r\\nyour gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?  Is\\r\\nnothing due to me on that score?  Let us sit down.  You are to\\r\\nunderstand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined\\r\\nresolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded\\r\\nfrom it.  I have not been used to submit to any person\\'s whims.\\r\\nI have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more\\r\\npitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not be interrupted.  Hear me in silence.  My daughter\\r\\nand my nephew are formed for each other.  They are descended,\\r\\non the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the\\r\\nfather\\'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient -- though\\r\\nuntitled -- families.  Their fortune on both sides is splendid.\\r\\nThey are destined for each other by the voice of every member\\r\\nof their respective houses; and what is to divide them?  The\\r\\nupstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\\r\\nconnections, or fortune.  Is this to be endured!  But it\\r\\nmust not, shall not be.  If you were sensible of your own\\r\\ngood, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you\\r\\nhave been brought up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\\r\\nquitting that sphere.  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s\\r\\ndaughter; so far we are equal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  You are a gentleman\\'s daughter.  But who was your\\r\\nmother?  Who are your uncles and aunts?  Do not imagine me\\r\\nignorant of their condition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your\\r\\nnephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging\\r\\nLady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but\\r\\nsay, after a moment\\'s deliberation,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\\r\\nengagement?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.  I expected to find a\\r\\nmore reasonable young woman.  But do not deceive yourself into\\r\\na belief that I will ever recede.  I shall not go away till you\\r\\nhave given me the assurance I require.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I certainly never shall give it.  I am not to be\\r\\nintimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.  Your\\r\\nladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would\\r\\nmy giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at\\r\\nall more probable?  Supposing him to be attached to me,\\r\\nwould my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow\\r\\nit on his cousin?  Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the\\r\\narguments with which you have supported this extraordinary\\r\\napplication have been as frivolous as the application was\\r\\nill-judged.  You have widely mistaken my character, if you\\r\\nthink I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\\r\\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in\\r\\nhis affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no\\r\\nright to concern yourself in mine.  I must beg, therefore,\\r\\nto be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please.  I have by no means done.\\r\\nTo all the objections I have already urged, I have still\\r\\nanother to add.  I am no stranger to the particulars of your\\r\\nyoungest sister\\'s infamous elopement.  I know it all; that\\r\\nthe young man\\'s marrying her was a patched-up business, at\\r\\nthe expence of your father and uncles.  And is such a girl\\r\\nto be my nephew\\'s sister?  Is her husband, is the son of\\r\\nhis late father\\'s steward, to be his brother?  Heaven and\\r\\nearth! -- of what are you thinking?  Are the shades of\\r\\nPemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can now have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully\\r\\nanswered.  \"You have insulted me in every possible method.\\r\\nI must beg to return to the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she rose as she spoke.  Lady Catherine rose also, and they\\r\\nturned back.  Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\\r\\nnephew!  Unfeeling, selfish girl!  Do you not consider that\\r\\na connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of\\r\\neverybody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.  You know my\\r\\nsentiments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have said no such thing.  I am only resolved to act in that\\r\\nmanner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\\r\\nwithout reference to you, or to any person so wholly\\r\\nunconnected with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is well.  You refuse, then, to oblige me.  You refuse to\\r\\nobey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.  You are\\r\\ndetermined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and\\r\\nmake him the contempt of the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n\"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.  No\\r\\nprinciple of either would be violated by my marriage with\\r\\nMr. Darcy.  And with regard to the resentment of his family, or\\r\\nthe indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his\\r\\nmarrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s concern -- and\\r\\nthe world in general would have too much sense to join in the\\r\\nscorn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is your real opinion!  This is your final resolve!\\r\\nVery well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do not imagine, Miss\\r\\nBennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.  I came to\\r\\ntry you.  I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it,\\r\\nI will carry my point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\\r\\ndoor of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,\\r\\n\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I send no compliments to\\r\\nyour mother.  You deserve no such attention.  I am most\\r\\nseriously displeased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade\\r\\nher ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\\r\\nherself.  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up\\r\\nstairs.  Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\\r\\ndressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in\\r\\nagain and rest herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman!  and her calling here was\\r\\nprodigiously civil!  for she only came, I suppose, to tell us\\r\\nthe Collinses were well.  She is on her road somewhere, I dare\\r\\nsay, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well\\r\\ncall on you.  I suppose she had nothing particular to say to\\r\\nyou, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here;\\r\\nfor to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 57\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit\\r\\nthrew Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could\\r\\nshe, for many hours, learn to think of it less than\\r\\nincessantly.  Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken\\r\\nthe trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose\\r\\nof breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.  It was\\r\\na rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of\\r\\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to\\r\\nimagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate\\r\\nfriend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was\\r\\nenough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made\\r\\nevery body eager for another, to supply the idea.  She had not\\r\\nherself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must\\r\\nbring them more frequently together.  And her neighbours at\\r\\nLucas lodge, therefore (for through their communication with\\r\\nthe Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady\\r\\nCatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and\\r\\nimmediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at\\r\\nsome future time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could\\r\\nnot help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence\\r\\nof her persisting in this interference.  From what she had said\\r\\nof her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\\r\\nElizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\\r\\nand how he might take a similar representation of the evils\\r\\nattached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.\\r\\nShe knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or\\r\\nhis dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\r\\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could\\r\\ndo; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a\\r\\nmarriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal\\r\\nto his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.\\r\\nWith his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the\\r\\narguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous,\\r\\ncontained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which\\r\\nhad often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a\\r\\nrelation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\\r\\nbe as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.  In that\\r\\ncase he would return no more.  Lady Catherine might see him in\\r\\nher way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming\\r\\nagain to Netherfield must give way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should\\r\\ncome to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall\\r\\nknow how to understand it.  I shall then give over every\\r\\nexpectation, every wish of his constancy.  If he is satisfied\\r\\nwith only regretting me, when he might have obtained my\\r\\naffections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\\r\\nvisitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\\r\\nit, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much\\r\\nteazing on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by\\r\\nher father, who came out of his library with a letter in his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he\\r\\nhad to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being\\r\\nin some manner connected with the letter he held.  It suddenly\\r\\nstruck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she\\r\\nanticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\\r\\ndown.  He then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\r\\nexceedingly.  As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to\\r\\nknow its contents.  I did not know before, that I had two\\r\\ndaughters on the brink of matrimony.  Let me congratulate you\\r\\non a very important conquest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the\\r\\ninstantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\\r\\ninstead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to\\r\\nbe pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that\\r\\nhis letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\\r\\ncontinued,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look conscious.  Young ladies have great penetration in\\r\\nsuch matters as these; but I think I may defy even your\\r\\nsagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.  This letter\\r\\nis from Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Mr. Collins!  and what can he have to say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course.  He begins\\r\\nwith congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest\\r\\ndaughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\\r\\ngood-natured, gossiping Lucases.  I shall not sport with your\\r\\nimpatience, by reading what he says on that point.  What\\r\\nrelates to yourself, is as follows.\"  \"Having thus offered\\r\\nyou the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\r\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject\\r\\nof another; of which we have been advertised by the same\\r\\nauthority.  Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not\\r\\nlong bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has\\r\\nresigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be\\r\\nreasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious\\r\\npersonages in this land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\"  \"This\\r\\nyoung gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing\\r\\nthe heart of mortal can most desire, -- splendid property,\\r\\nnoble kindred, and extensive patronage.  Yet in spite of all\\r\\nthese temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and\\r\\nyourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure\\r\\nwith this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be\\r\\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?  But now it\\r\\ncomes out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My motive for cautioning you is as follows.  We have reason to\\r\\nimagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look\\r\\non the match with a friendly eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man!  Now, Lizzy, I think I\\r\\nhave surprised you.  Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched\\r\\non any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name\\r\\nwould have given the lie more effectually to what they related?\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish,\\r\\nand who probably never looked at you in his life!  It is\\r\\nadmirable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could\\r\\nonly force one most reluctant smile.  Never had his wit been\\r\\ndirected in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  yes.  Pray read on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\\r\\nladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\\r\\ncondescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it\\r\\nbecome apparent, that on the score of some family objections on\\r\\nthe part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what\\r\\nshe termed so disgraceful a match.  I thought it my duty to\\r\\ngive the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\\r\\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and\\r\\nnot run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly\\r\\nsanctioned.\"  \"Mr. Collins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced\\r\\nthat my cousin Lydia\\'s sad business has been so well hushed up,\\r\\nand am only concerned that their living together before the\\r\\nmarriage took place should be so generally known.  I must not,\\r\\nhowever, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from\\r\\ndeclaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\\r\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married.  It was an\\r\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn,\\r\\nI should very strenuously have opposed it.  You ought certainly\\r\\nto forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your\\r\\nsight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\"\\r\\n\"That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!  The rest of\\r\\nhis letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s situation, and\\r\\nhis expectation of a young olive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look\\r\\nas if you did not enjoy it.  You are not going to be Missish,\\r\\nI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.  For\\r\\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and\\r\\nlaugh at them in our turn?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted.  But it is\\r\\nso strange!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes -- that is what makes it amusing.  Had they fixed on\\r\\nany other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect\\r\\nindifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so\\r\\ndelightfully absurd!  Much as I abominate writing, I would not\\r\\ngive up Mr. Collins\\'s correspondence for any consideration.\\r\\nNay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the\\r\\npreference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\r\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law.  And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady\\r\\nCatherine about this report?  Did she call to refuse her\\r\\nconsent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and\\r\\nas it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\\r\\ndistressed by his repeating it.  Elizabeth had never been\\r\\nmore at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\\r\\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\\r\\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder\\r\\nat such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\\r\\nhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 58\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTEAD of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,\\r\\nas Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to\\r\\nbring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed\\r\\nafter Lady Catherine\\'s visit.  The gentlemen arrived early;\\r\\nand, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having\\r\\nseen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread,\\r\\nBingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all\\r\\nwalking out.  It was agreed to.  Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\r\\nhabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the\\r\\nremaining five set off together.  Bingley and Jane, however,\\r\\nsoon allowed the others to outstrip them.  They lagged behind,\\r\\nwhile Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\\r\\nVery little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of\\r\\nhim to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate\\r\\nresolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\\r\\nupon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a\\r\\ngeneral concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with\\r\\nhim alone.  Now was the moment for her resolution to be\\r\\nexecuted, and, while her courage was high, she immediately\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of\\r\\ngiving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be\\r\\nwounding your\\'s.  I can no longer help thanking you for your\\r\\nunexampled kindness to my poor sister.  Ever since I have known\\r\\nit, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how\\r\\ngratefully I feel it.  Were it known to the rest of my family,\\r\\nI should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of\\r\\nsurprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what\\r\\nmay, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.  I did not\\r\\nthink Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not blame my aunt.  Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first\\r\\nbetrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and,\\r\\nof course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.  Let\\r\\nme thank you again and again, in the name of all my family,\\r\\nfor that generous compassion which induced you to take so much\\r\\ntrouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of\\r\\ndiscovering them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself\\r\\nalone.  That the wish of giving happiness to you might add\\r\\nforce to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not\\r\\nattempt to deny.  But your family owe me nothing.  Much as\\r\\nI respect them, I believe I thought only of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.  After a\\r\\nshort pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to\\r\\ntrifle with me.  If your feelings are still what they were\\r\\nlast April, tell me so at once.  My affections and wishes\\r\\nare unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this\\r\\nsubject for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and\\r\\nanxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and\\r\\nimmediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand\\r\\nthat her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since\\r\\nthe period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with\\r\\ngratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness\\r\\nwhich this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\\r\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as\\r\\nsensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be\\r\\nsupposed to do.  Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his\\r\\neye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt\\r\\ndelight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she\\r\\ncould not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings,\\r\\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\\r\\naffection every moment more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction.  There was\\r\\ntoo much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to\\r\\nany other objects.  She soon learnt that they were indebted\\r\\nfor their present good understanding to the efforts of his\\r\\naunt, who did call on him in her return through London,\\r\\nand there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and\\r\\nthe substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling\\r\\nemphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her\\r\\nladyship\\'s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness\\r\\nand assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist\\r\\nher endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which\\r\\nshe had refused to give.  But, unluckily for her ladyship,\\r\\nits effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever\\r\\nallowed myself to hope before.  I knew enough of your\\r\\ndisposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely,\\r\\nirrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged\\r\\nit to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know\\r\\nenough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.\\r\\nAfter abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no\\r\\nscruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?  For, though\\r\\nyour accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises,\\r\\nmy behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest\\r\\nreproof.  It was unpardonable.  I cannot think of it without\\r\\nabhorrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to\\r\\nthat evening,\" said Elizabeth.  \"The conduct of neither, if\\r\\nstrictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we\\r\\nhave both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.  The recollection\\r\\nof what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions\\r\\nduring the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,\\r\\ninexpressibly painful to me.  Your reproof, so well applied, I\\r\\nshall never forget: ``had you behaved in a more gentleman-like\\r\\nmanner.\\'\\' Those were your words.  You know not, you can\\r\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; -- though it was\\r\\nsome time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow\\r\\ntheir justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong\\r\\nan impression.  I had not the smallest idea of their being ever\\r\\nfelt in such a way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can easily believe it.  You thought me then devoid of\\r\\nevery proper feeling, I am sure you did.  The turn of your\\r\\ncountenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could\\r\\nnot have addressed you in any possible way that would induce\\r\\nyou to accept me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  do not repeat what I then said.  These recollections\\r\\nwill not do at all.  I assure you that I have long been most\\r\\nheartily ashamed of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy mentioned his letter.  \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon\\r\\nmake you think better of me?  Did you, on reading it, give any\\r\\ncredit to its contents?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how\\r\\ngradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain,\\r\\nbut it was necessary.  I hope you have destroyed the letter.\\r\\nThere was one part especially, the opening of it, which I\\r\\nshould dread your having the power of reading again.  I can\\r\\nremember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it\\r\\nessential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have\\r\\nboth reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they\\r\\nare not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself\\r\\nperfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was\\r\\nwritten in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end\\r\\nso.  The adieu is charity itself.  But think no more of the\\r\\nletter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person\\r\\nwho received it, are now so widely different from what they\\r\\nwere then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it\\r\\nought to be forgotten.  You must learn some of my philosophy.\\r\\nThink only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\\r\\nYour retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that\\r\\nthe contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,\\r\\nwhat is much better, of innocence.  But with me, it is not\\r\\nso.  Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which\\r\\nought not, to be repelled.  I have been a selfish being all my\\r\\nlife, in practice, though not in principle.  As a child I was\\r\\ntaught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my\\r\\ntemper.  I was given good principles, but left to follow them\\r\\nin pride and conceit.  Unfortunately an only son (for many\\r\\nyears an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though\\r\\ngood themselves (my father, particularly, all that was\\r\\nbenevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me\\r\\nto be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own\\r\\nfamily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to\\r\\nwish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth\\r\\ncompared with my own.  Such I was, from eight to eight and\\r\\ntwenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,\\r\\nloveliest Elizabeth!  What do I not owe you!  You taught me a\\r\\nlesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.  By you,\\r\\nI was properly humbled.  I came to you without a doubt of my\\r\\nreception.  You shewed me how insufficient were all my\\r\\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I had.  What will you think of my vanity?  I believed\\r\\nyou to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally,\\r\\nI assure you.  I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits\\r\\nmight often lead me wrong.  How you must have hated me after\\r\\nthat evening?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hate you!  I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon\\r\\nbegan to take a proper direction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we\\r\\nmet at Pemberley.  You blamed me for coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being\\r\\nnoticed by you.  My conscience told me that I deserved no\\r\\nextraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect\\r\\nto receive more than my due.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every\\r\\ncivility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the\\r\\npast; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your\\r\\nill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been\\r\\nattended to.  How soon any other wishes introduced themselves\\r\\nI can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after\\r\\nI had seen you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance,\\r\\nand of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which\\r\\nnaturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon\\r\\nlearnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in\\r\\nquest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn,\\r\\nand that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from\\r\\nno other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\\r\\nsubject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy\\r\\nto know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining\\r\\ntheir watches, that it was time to be at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder\\r\\nwhich introduced the discussion of their affairs.  Darcy\\r\\nwas delighted with their engagement; his friend had given\\r\\nhim the earliest information of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.  When I went away, I felt that it would soon\\r\\nhappen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission.  I guessed as\\r\\nmuch.\"  And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it\\r\\nhad been pretty much the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I made a\\r\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long\\r\\nago.  I told him of all that had occurred to make my former\\r\\ninterference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.  His\\r\\nsurprise was great.  He had never had the slightest suspicion.\\r\\nI told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in\\r\\nsupposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to\\r\\nhim; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her\\r\\nwas unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of\\r\\ndirecting his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when\\r\\nyou told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my\\r\\ninformation last spring?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the former.  I had narrowly observed her during the two\\r\\nvisits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her\\r\\naffection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\\r\\nconviction to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It did.  Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.  His diffidence\\r\\nhad prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a\\r\\ncase, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.  I was\\r\\nobliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not\\r\\nunjustly, offended him.  I could not allow myself to conceal\\r\\nthat your sister had been in town three months last winter,\\r\\nthat I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.  He was\\r\\nangry.  But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than\\r\\nhe remained in any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments.  He has\\r\\nheartily forgiven me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most\\r\\ndelightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\\r\\ninvaluable; but she checked herself.  She remembered that he\\r\\nhad yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early\\r\\nto begin.  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of\\r\\ncourse was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\\r\\nconversation till they reached the house.  In the hall they\\r\\nparted.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 59\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a\\r\\nquestion which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she\\r\\nentered their room, and from all the others when they sat down\\r\\nto table.  She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered\\r\\nabout, till she was beyond her own knowledge.  She coloured as\\r\\nshe spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a\\r\\nsuspicion of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing\\r\\nextraordinary.  The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the\\r\\nunacknowledged were silent.  Darcy was not of a disposition in\\r\\nwhich happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and\\r\\nconfused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself\\r\\nto be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were\\r\\nother evils before her.  She anticipated what would be felt in\\r\\nthe family when her situation became known; she was aware that\\r\\nno one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others\\r\\nit was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence\\r\\nmight do away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane.  Though suspicion was\\r\\nvery far from Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely\\r\\nincredulous here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy.  This cannot be! -- engaged to\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  No, no, you shall not deceive me.  I know it\\r\\nto be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed!  My sole dependence was\\r\\non you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do\\r\\nnot.  Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.  I speak nothing but the\\r\\ntruth.  He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at her doubtingly.  \"Oh, Lizzy!  it cannot be.\\r\\nI know how much you dislike him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know nothing of the matter.  That is all to be forgot.\\r\\nPerhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in\\r\\nsuch cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is\\r\\nthe last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement.  Elizabeth again, and\\r\\nmore seriously assured her of its truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven!  can it be really so!  Yet now I must believe\\r\\nyou,\" cried Jane.  \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would -- I do\\r\\ncongratulate you -- but are you certain?  forgive the question\\r\\n-- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no doubt of that.  It is settled between us\\r\\nalready, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.\\r\\nBut are you pleased, Jane?  Shall you like to have such a\\r\\nbrother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very, very much.  Nothing could give either Bingley or\\r\\nmyself more delight.  But we considered it, we talked of it as\\r\\nimpossible.  And do you really love him quite well enough?\\r\\nOh, Lizzy!  do any thing rather than marry without affection.\\r\\nAre you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  You will only think I feel more than I ought to\\r\\ndo, when I tell you all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.\\r\\nI am afraid you will be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest sister, now be serious.  I want to talk very\\r\\nseriously.  Let me know every thing that I am to know, without\\r\\ndelay.  Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\\r\\nbegan.  But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his\\r\\nbeautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced\\r\\nthe desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn\\r\\nassurances of attachment.  When convinced on that article, Miss\\r\\nBennet had nothing farther to wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as\\r\\nmyself.  I always had a value for him.  Were it for nothing but\\r\\nhis love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as\\r\\nBingley\\'s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley\\r\\nand yourself more dear to me.  But Lizzy, you have been very\\r\\nsly, very reserved with me.  How little did you tell me of what\\r\\npassed at Pemberley and Lambton!  I owe all that I know of it\\r\\nto another, not to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.  She had been\\r\\nunwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her\\r\\nown feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.\\r\\nBut now she would no longer conceal from her his share in\\r\\nLydia\\'s marriage.  All was acknowledged, and half the night\\r\\nspent in conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window\\r\\nthe next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming\\r\\nhere again with our dear Bingley!  What can he mean by being so\\r\\ntiresome as to be always coming here?  I had no notion but he\\r\\nwould go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us\\r\\nwith his company.  What shall we do with him?  Lizzy, you must\\r\\nwalk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a\\r\\nproposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be\\r\\nalways giving him such an epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,\\r\\nand shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good\\r\\ninformation; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\nhave you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her\\r\\nway again to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.  It is a nice long walk,\\r\\nand Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but\\r\\nI am sure it will be too much for Kitty.  Won\\'t it, Kitty?\"\\r\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home.  Darcy professed\\r\\na great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth\\r\\nsilently consented.  As she went up stairs to get ready,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet followed her, saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have\\r\\nthat disagreeable man all to yourself.  But I hope you will not\\r\\nmind it: it is all for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no\\r\\noccasion for talking to him, except just now and then.  So, do\\r\\nnot put yourself to inconvenience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\'s consent\\r\\nshould be asked in the course of the evening.  Elizabeth\\r\\nreserved to herself the application for her mother\\'s.  She\\r\\ncould not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes\\r\\ndoubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough\\r\\nto overcome her abhorrence of the man.  But whether she were\\r\\nviolently set against the match, or violently delighted with\\r\\nit, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted\\r\\nto do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that\\r\\nMr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the\\r\\nfirst vehemence of her disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,\\r\\nshe saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation\\r\\non seeing it was extreme.  She did not fear her father\\'s\\r\\nopposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it\\r\\nshould be through her means -- that she, his favourite child,\\r\\nshould be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him\\r\\nwith fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched\\r\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared\\r\\nagain, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his\\r\\nsmile.  In a few minutes he approached the table where she was\\r\\nsitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work\\r\\nsaid in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in the\\r\\nlibrary.\"  She was gone directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and\\r\\nanxious.  \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing?  Are you out\\r\\nof your senses, to be accepting this man?  Have not you always\\r\\nhated him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had\\r\\nbeen more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!  It would\\r\\nhave spared her from explanations and professions which it was\\r\\nexceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and\\r\\nshe assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to\\r\\nMr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.  He is\\r\\nrich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine\\r\\ncarriages than Jane.  But will they make you happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your\\r\\nbelief of my indifference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None at all.  We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort\\r\\nof man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes,\\r\\n\"I love him.  Indeed he has no improper pride.  He is perfectly\\r\\namiable.  You do not know what he really is; then pray do not\\r\\npain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent.\\r\\nHe is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare\\r\\nrefuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.  I now give it\\r\\nto you, if you are resolved on having him.  But let me advise\\r\\nyou to think better of it.  I know your disposition, Lizzy.\\r\\nI know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless\\r\\nyou truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him\\r\\nas a superior.  Your lively talents would place you in the\\r\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage.  You could scarcely\\r\\nescape discredit and misery.  My child, let me not have the\\r\\ngrief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.\\r\\nYou know not what you are about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her\\r\\nreply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was\\r\\nreally the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual\\r\\nchange which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her\\r\\nabsolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a\\r\\nday, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and\\r\\nenumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer\\r\\nher father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no\\r\\nmore to say.  If this be the case, he deserves you.  I could\\r\\nnot have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what\\r\\nMr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.  He heard her with\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!  And so, Darcy did\\r\\nevery thing: made up the match, gave the money, paid the\\r\\nfellow\\'s debts, and got him his commission!  So much the\\r\\nbetter.  It will save me a world of trouble and economy.\\r\\nHad it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and would have paid\\r\\nhim; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their\\r\\nown way.  I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant\\r\\nand storm about his love for you, and there will be an end\\r\\nof the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\\r\\nreading Mr. Collins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some\\r\\ntime, allowed her at last to go -- saying, as she quitted the\\r\\nroom, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in,\\r\\nfor I am quite at leisure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight;\\r\\nand, after half an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room,\\r\\nshe was able to join the others with tolerable composure.\\r\\nEvery thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed\\r\\ntranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to\\r\\nbe dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would\\r\\ncome in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she\\r\\nfollowed her, and made the important communication.  Its effect\\r\\nwas most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.  Nor was it\\r\\nunder many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she\\r\\nheard; though not in general backward to credit what was for\\r\\nthe advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\r\\nlover to any of them.  She began at length to recover, to\\r\\nfidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder,\\r\\nand bless herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Lord bless me!  only think!  dear me!\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  Who would have thought it!  And is it really true?\\r\\nOh!  my sweetest Lizzy!  how rich and how great you will be!\\r\\nWhat pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!\\r\\nJane\\'s is nothing to it -- nothing at all.  I am so pleased --\\r\\nso happy.  Such a charming man! -- so handsome!  so tall! --\\r\\nOh, my dear Lizzy!  pray apologise for my having disliked him\\r\\nso much before.  I hope he will overlook it.  Dear, dear Lizzy.\\r\\nA house in town!  Every thing that is charming!  Three\\r\\ndaughters married!  Ten thousand a year!  Oh, Lord!  What will\\r\\nbecome of me.  I shall go distracted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\\r\\ndoubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was\\r\\nheard only by herself, soon went away.  But before she had\\r\\nbeen three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else!\\r\\nTen thousand a year, and very likely more!  \\'Tis as good as a\\r\\nLord!  And a special licence.  You must and shall be married\\r\\nby a special licence.  But my dearest love, tell me what dish\\r\\nMr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it\\r\\ntomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the\\r\\ngentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in\\r\\nthe certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of\\r\\nher relations\\' consent, there was still something to be wished\\r\\nfor.  But the morrow passed off much better than she expected;\\r\\nfor Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended\\r\\nson-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was\\r\\nin her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference\\r\\nfor his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking\\r\\npains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured\\r\\nher that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he.\\r\\n\"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall\\r\\nlike your husband quite as well as Jane\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 60\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH\\'S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she\\r\\nwanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love\\r\\nwith her.  \"How could you begin?\" said she.  \"I can comprehend\\r\\nyour going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning;\\r\\nbut what could set you off in the first place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\\r\\nwords, which laid the foundation.  It is too long ago.  I was\\r\\nin the middle before I knew that I had begun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners --\\r\\nmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the\\r\\nuncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to\\r\\ngive you pain than not.  Now be sincere; did you admire me for\\r\\nmy impertinence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once.  It was very\\r\\nlittle less.  The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of\\r\\ndeference, of officious attention.  You were disgusted with the\\r\\nwomen who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for\\r\\nyour approbation alone.  I roused, and interested you,\\r\\nbecause I was so unlike them.  Had you not been really\\r\\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the\\r\\npains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always\\r\\nnoble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the\\r\\npersons who so assiduously courted you.  There -- I have saved\\r\\nyou the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things\\r\\nconsidered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.  To be\\r\\nsure, you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of\\r\\nthat when they fall in love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\\r\\nshe was ill at Netherfield?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dearest Jane!  who could have done less for her?  But make a\\r\\nvirtue of it by all means.  My good qualities are under your\\r\\nprotection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;\\r\\nand, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing\\r\\nand quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin\\r\\ndirectly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to\\r\\nthe point at last.  What made you so shy of me, when you first\\r\\ncalled, and afterwards dined here?  Why, especially, when you\\r\\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\\r\\nencouragement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so was I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\\r\\nand that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!  But I\\r\\nwonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left\\r\\nto yourself.  I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had\\r\\nnot asked you!  My resolution of thanking you for your kindness\\r\\nto Lydia had certainly great effect.  Too much, I am\\r\\nafraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs\\r\\nfrom a breach of promise?  for I ought not to have mentioned\\r\\nthe subject.  This will never do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not distress yourself.  The moral will be perfectly\\r\\nfair.  Lady Catherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us\\r\\nwere the means of removing all my doubts.  I am not indebted\\r\\nfor my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing\\r\\nyour gratitude.  I was not in a humour to wait for any opening\\r\\nof your\\'s.  My aunt\\'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was\\r\\ndetermined at once to know every thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make\\r\\nher happy, for she loves to be of use.  But tell me, what did\\r\\nyou come down to Netherfield for?  Was it merely to ride to\\r\\nLongbourn and be embarrassed?  or had you intended any more\\r\\nserious consequence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could,\\r\\nwhether I might ever hope to make you love me.  My avowed one,\\r\\nor what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were\\r\\nstill partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the\\r\\nconfession to him which I have since made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine\\r\\nwhat is to befall her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.\\r\\nBut it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper,\\r\\nit shall be done directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\\r\\nand admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady\\r\\nonce did.  But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer\\r\\nneglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with\\r\\nMr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet\\r\\nanswered Mrs. Gardiner\\'s long letter; but now, having that\\r\\nto communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was\\r\\nalmost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost\\r\\nthree days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought\\r\\nto have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\\r\\nparticulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.\\r\\nYou supposed more than really existed.  But now suppose as\\r\\nmuch as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your\\r\\nimagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\r\\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot\\r\\ngreatly err.  You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\r\\ngreat deal more than you did in your last.  I thank you, again\\r\\nand again, for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly\\r\\nas to wish it!  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We will\\r\\ngo round the Park every day.  I am the happiest creature in the\\r\\nworld.  Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one\\r\\nwith such justice.  I am happier even than Jane; she only\\r\\nsmiles, I laugh.  Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world\\r\\nthat he can spare from me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at\\r\\nChristmas.  Your\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;\\r\\nand still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to\\r\\nMr. Collins, in reply to his last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\r\\n\\r\\nI must trouble you once more for congratulations.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwill soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.  Console Lady Catherine\\r\\nas well as you can.  But, if I were you, I would stand by the\\r\\nnephew.  He has more to give.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s sincerely, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his\\r\\napproaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and\\r\\ninsincere.  She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express\\r\\nher delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.\\r\\nJane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling\\r\\nno reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder\\r\\nanswer than she knew was deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar\\r\\ninformation, was as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it.\\r\\nFour sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her\\r\\ndelight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any\\r\\ncongratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn\\r\\nfamily heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas\\r\\nlodge.  The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.\\r\\nLady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by\\r\\nthe contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that Charlotte, really\\r\\nrejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the\\r\\nstorm was blown over.  At such a moment, the arrival of\\r\\nher friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in\\r\\nthe course of their meetings she must sometimes think the\\r\\npleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all\\r\\nthe parading and obsequious civility of her husband.  He bore\\r\\nit, however, with admirable calmness.  He could even listen to\\r\\nSir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\r\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of\\r\\ntheir all meeting frequently at St. James\\'s, with very decent\\r\\ncomposure.  If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir\\r\\nWilliam was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater,\\r\\ntax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as\\r\\nher sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the\\r\\nfamiliarity which Bingley\\'s good humour encouraged, yet,\\r\\nwhenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.  Nor was her\\r\\nrespect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely\\r\\nto make her more elegant.  Elizabeth did all she could to\\r\\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever\\r\\nanxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with\\r\\nwhom he might converse without mortification; and though the\\r\\nuncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the\\r\\nseason of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope\\r\\nof the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time\\r\\nwhen they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\\r\\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party\\r\\nat Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 61\\r\\n\\r\\nHAPPY for all her maternal feelings was the day on which\\r\\nMrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\r\\nWith what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,\\r\\nand talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.  I wish I could say,\\r\\nfor the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her\\r\\nearnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children\\r\\nproduced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\\r\\nwell-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it\\r\\nwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\\r\\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally\\r\\nnervous and invariably silly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his\\r\\naffection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing\\r\\nelse could do.  He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially\\r\\nwhen he was least expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a\\r\\ntwelvemonth.  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton\\r\\nrelations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her\\r\\naffectionate heart.  The darling wish of his sisters was then\\r\\ngratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to\\r\\nDerbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other\\r\\nsource of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\\r\\ntime with her two elder sisters.  In society so superior to\\r\\nwhat she had generally known, her improvement was great.  She\\r\\nwas not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from\\r\\nthe influence of Lydia\\'s example, she became, by proper\\r\\nattention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and\\r\\nless insipid.  From the farther disadvantage of Lydia\\'s society\\r\\nshe was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\\r\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the\\r\\npromise of balls and young men, her father would never consent\\r\\nto her going.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\\r\\nnecessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s being quite unable to sit alone.  Mary was\\r\\nobliged to mix more with the world, but she could still\\r\\nmoralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer\\r\\nmortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her\\r\\nown, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to\\r\\nthe change without much reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no\\r\\nrevolution from the marriage of her sisters.  He bore with\\r\\nphilosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become\\r\\nacquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood\\r\\nhad before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing,\\r\\nwas not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed\\r\\non to make his fortune.  The congratulatory letter which\\r\\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to\\r\\nher that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a\\r\\nhope was cherished.  The letter was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish you joy.  If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my\\r\\ndear Wickham, you must be very happy.  It is a great comfort to\\r\\nhave you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope\\r\\nyou will think of us.  I am sure Wickham would like a place at\\r\\ncourt very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money\\r\\nenough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of\\r\\nabout three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak\\r\\nto Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she\\r\\nendeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty\\r\\nand expectation of the kind.  Such relief, however, as it\\r\\nwas in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be\\r\\ncalled economy in her own private expences, she frequently\\r\\nsent them.  It had always been evident to her that such an\\r\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so\\r\\nextravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must\\r\\nbe very insufficient to their support; and whenever they\\r\\nchanged their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of\\r\\nbeing applied to for some little assistance towards discharging\\r\\ntheir bills.  Their manner of living, even when the restoration\\r\\nof peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\r\\nextreme.  They were always moving from place to place in quest\\r\\nof a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.\\r\\nHis affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her\\'s lasted\\r\\na little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she\\r\\nretained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had\\r\\ngiven her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.\\r\\nLydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was\\r\\ngone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys\\r\\nthey both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\'s\\r\\ngood humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk\\r\\nof giving them a hint to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but\\r\\nas she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at\\r\\nPemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever\\r\\nof Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and\\r\\npaid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the\\r\\nsisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.  They were\\r\\nable to love each other even as well as they intended.\\r\\nGeorgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;\\r\\nthough at first she often listened with an astonishment\\r\\nbordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking\\r\\nto her brother.  He, who had always inspired in herself a\\r\\nrespect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the\\r\\nobject of open pleasantry.  Her mind received knowledge which\\r\\nhad never before fallen in her way.  By Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\ninstructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take\\r\\nliberties with her husband which a brother will not always\\r\\nallow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\\r\\nnephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her\\r\\ncharacter in her reply to the letter which announced its\\r\\narrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially\\r\\nof Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.\\r\\nBut at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion, he was prevailed on\\r\\nto overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after\\r\\na little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\r\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her\\r\\ncuriosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she\\r\\ncondescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that\\r\\npollution which its woods had received, not merely from the\\r\\npresence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and\\r\\naunt from the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate\\r\\nterms.  Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and\\r\\nthey were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards\\r\\nthe persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the\\r\\nmeans of uniting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

This was the page at which\\r\\nthe favourite volume always opened:\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\n\"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,\\r\\ndaughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of\\r\\nGloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth,\\r\\nborn June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son,\\r\\nNovember 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s hands;\\r\\nbut Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\\r\\nhimself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary\\'s\\r\\nbirth--\"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles\\r\\nMusgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\"\\r\\nand by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which\\r\\nhe had lost his wife.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,\\r\\nin the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;\\r\\nhow mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,\\r\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments,\\r\\nexertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year\\r\\nof Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married;\\r\\nforming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with\\r\\nthe arms and motto:--\"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county\\r\\nof Somerset,\" and Sir Walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale:--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of\\r\\nthe second Sir Walter.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nVanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot\\'s character;\\r\\nvanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome\\r\\nin his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.\\r\\nFew women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,\\r\\nnor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with\\r\\nthe place he held in society.  He considered the blessing of beauty\\r\\nas inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot,\\r\\nwho united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect\\r\\nand devotion.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;\\r\\nsince to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character\\r\\nto any thing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,\\r\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\r\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot,\\r\\nhad never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured,\\r\\nor softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real\\r\\nrespectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest\\r\\nbeing in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,\\r\\nand her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of\\r\\nindifference to her when she was called on to quit them.--Three\\r\\ngirls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy\\r\\nfor a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to\\r\\nthe authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.\\r\\nShe had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,\\r\\nwho had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle\\r\\nclose by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,\\r\\nLady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of\\r\\nthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously\\r\\ngiving her daughters.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\r\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years\\r\\nhad passed away since Lady Elliot\\'s death, and they were still\\r\\nnear neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,\\r\\nthe other a widow.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThat Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely\\r\\nwell provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,\\r\\nneeds no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\r\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;\\r\\nbut Sir Walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation.\\r\\nBe it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with\\r\\none or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\r\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake.\\r\\nFor one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\r\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had succeeded,\\r\\nat sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights\\r\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,\\r\\nher influence had always been great, and they had gone on together\\r\\nmost happily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.\\r\\nMary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming\\r\\nMrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness\\r\\nof character, which must have placed her high with any people\\r\\nof real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;\\r\\nher word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--she\\r\\nwas only Anne.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTo Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\r\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all;\\r\\nbut it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl,\\r\\nbut her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,\\r\\nher father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different\\r\\nwere her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),\\r\\nthere could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,\\r\\nto excite his esteem. He had never indulged much hope, he had now none,\\r\\nof ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.\\r\\nAll equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely\\r\\nconnected herself with an old country family of respectability and\\r\\nlarge fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:\\r\\nElizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than\\r\\nshe was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\r\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any\\r\\ncharm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome\\r\\nMiss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter\\r\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,\\r\\nbe deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth\\r\\nas blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else;\\r\\nfor he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and\\r\\nacquaintance were growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face\\r\\nin the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot\\r\\nabout Lady Russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nElizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\r\\nThirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and\\r\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have given\\r\\nthe idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years had\\r\\nshe been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,\\r\\nand leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after\\r\\nLady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.\\r\\nThirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball\\r\\nof credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs\\r\\nshewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father,\\r\\nfor a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the great world.  She had\\r\\nthe remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being\\r\\nnine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;\\r\\nshe was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,\\r\\nbut she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced\\r\\nto be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within\\r\\nthe next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again take up\\r\\nthe book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\r\\nbut now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of\\r\\nher own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\r\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\r\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,\\r\\nand pushed it away.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,\\r\\nand especially the history of her own family, must ever present\\r\\nthe remembrance of.  The heir presumptive, the very William Walter\\r\\nElliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported\\r\\nby her father, had disappointed her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\r\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,\\r\\nmeant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.\\r\\nHe had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot\\'s death,\\r\\nSir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures\\r\\nhad not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,\\r\\nmaking allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of\\r\\ntheir spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,\\r\\nMr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;\\r\\nand Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour\\r\\nwas confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of\\r\\nand expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.\\r\\nThe following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\r\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;\\r\\nand the next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing\\r\\nhis fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,\\r\\nhe had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman\\r\\nof inferior birth.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter had resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that\\r\\nhe ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man\\r\\nso publicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\"\\r\\nhe observed, \"once at Tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of\\r\\nthe House of Commons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed,\\r\\nbut apparently very little regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology,\\r\\nand shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,\\r\\nas Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between\\r\\nthem had ceased.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval\\r\\nof several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man\\r\\nfor himself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose\\r\\nstrong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\\r\\nElliot\\'s eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom\\r\\nher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.\\r\\nYet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was\\r\\nat this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons\\r\\nfor his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.\\r\\nThe disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was\\r\\nno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,\\r\\nhad he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention\\r\\nof kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully\\r\\nof them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\\r\\nhe belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.\\r\\nThis could not be pardoned.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSuch were Elizabeth Elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\r\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,\\r\\nthe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;\\r\\nsuch the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence\\r\\nin one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\\r\\nof utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\r\\nadded to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.\\r\\nShe knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive\\r\\nthe heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of\\r\\nMr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good,\\r\\nbut not equal to Sir Walter\\'s apprehension of the state required\\r\\nin its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,\\r\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;\\r\\nbut with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period\\r\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible\\r\\nfor him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot\\r\\nwas imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was\\r\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,\\r\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,\\r\\nfrom his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring\\r\\nin town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?\\r\\nDoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\r\\nwe can retrench?\" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first\\r\\nardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,\\r\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off\\r\\nsome unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing\\r\\nthe drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added\\r\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,\\r\\nas had been the usual yearly custom.  But these measures,\\r\\nhowever good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent\\r\\nof the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\\r\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose\\r\\nof deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,\\r\\nas did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise\\r\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,\\r\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of;\\r\\nbut had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.\\r\\nHe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,\\r\\nbut he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never disgrace\\r\\nhis name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\r\\nand entire, as he had received it.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTheir two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in\\r\\nthe neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;\\r\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\r\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\r\\nand reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of\\r\\nany indulgence of taste or pride.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap02\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\r\\nor his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable\\r\\nprompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,\\r\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\r\\nthe excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense\\r\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\r\\nhe meant to see finally adopted.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\r\\nmuch serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of\\r\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\r\\nin this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\r\\nShe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\r\\nbut she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous\\r\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\r\\nwas due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.\\r\\nShe was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of\\r\\nstrong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions\\r\\nof decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.\\r\\nShe had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,\\r\\nrational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;\\r\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little\\r\\nto the faults of those who possessed them.  Herself the widow of\\r\\nonly a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;\\r\\nand Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,\\r\\nan attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her\\r\\nvery dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was,\\r\\nas being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal\\r\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was\\r\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\r\\nand Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\r\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne,\\r\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\r\\nin the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her\\r\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\r\\nto Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne\\'s had been on the side of\\r\\nhonesty against importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures,\\r\\na more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,\\r\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell,\\r\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  If he will adopt\\r\\nthese regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope\\r\\nwe may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has\\r\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;\\r\\nand that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from\\r\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.\\r\\nWhat will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families\\r\\nhave done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case;\\r\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,\\r\\nas it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.\\r\\nWe must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who\\r\\nhas contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to\\r\\nthe feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\r\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding,\\r\\nhis friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act\\r\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\r\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\r\\ncould secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.\\r\\nShe wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s influence highly; and as to the severe degree\\r\\nof self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed\\r\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,\\r\\nthan to half a reformation.  Her knowledge of her father\\r\\nand Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\r\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,\\r\\nthrough the whole list of Lady Russell\\'s too gentle reductions.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHow Anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\r\\nis of little consequence.  Lady Russell\\'s had no success at all:\\r\\ncould not be put up with, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort\\r\\nof life knocked off!  Journeys, London, servants, horses,\\r\\ntable--contractions and restrictions every where!  To live no longer\\r\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman!  No, he would sooner\\r\\nquit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd,\\r\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter\\'s retrenching,\\r\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\r\\na change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\r\\nwhich ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing\\r\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not appear to him\\r\\nthat Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\r\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.\\r\\nIn any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would\\r\\nbe looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\r\\nhe might choose to model his household.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more\\r\\nof doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go\\r\\nwas settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house\\r\\nin the country.  All Anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter.\\r\\nA small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure\\r\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object\\r\\nof her ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her,\\r\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.\\r\\nShe disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her;\\r\\nand Bath was to be her home.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt\\r\\nthat he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough\\r\\nto dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer\\r\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\r\\nat comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath\\r\\nover London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\r\\ndistance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell\\'s spending\\r\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction\\r\\nof Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been\\r\\nfor Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that\\r\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne\\'s known wishes.\\r\\nIt would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house\\r\\nin his own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found\\r\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter\\'s\\r\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne\\'s\\r\\ndislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\r\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years\\r\\nat school there, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly,\\r\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\r\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think\\r\\nit must suit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health,\\r\\nby passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,\\r\\nevery danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must\\r\\ndo both health and spirits good.  Anne had been too little from home,\\r\\ntoo little seen. Her spirits were not high.  A larger society\\r\\nwould improve them.  She wanted her to be more known.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\r\\nfor Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,\\r\\nand a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily\\r\\nengrafted on the beginning.  He was not only to quit his home,\\r\\nbut to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,\\r\\nwhich stronger heads than Sir Walter\\'s have found too much.\\r\\nKellynch Hall was to be let.  This, however, was a profound secret,\\r\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\r\\nto design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\\r\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned\\r\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\r\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on\\r\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\r\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\r\\nthat he would let it at all.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell had\\r\\nanother excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter\\r\\nand his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had been\\r\\nlately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\r\\nIt was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned,\\r\\nafter an unprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with\\r\\nthe additional burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman,\\r\\nwho understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,\\r\\nat Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,\\r\\nas to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all\\r\\nthat Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,\\r\\ncould hint of caution and reserve.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,\\r\\nand seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,\\r\\nthan because Elizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more\\r\\nthan outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;\\r\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,\\r\\nagainst previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest\\r\\nin trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open\\r\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\r\\nwhich shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\r\\nto give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;\\r\\nbut always in vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she\\r\\npursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in\\r\\nthis selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving\\r\\na sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\r\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nFrom situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell\\'s estimate, a very unequal,\\r\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\r\\nand a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice\\r\\nof more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot\\'s reach, was therefore\\r\\nan object of first-rate importance.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap03\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd\\r\\none morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper,\\r\\n\"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will\\r\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore.  They will be\\r\\nall wanting a home.  Could not be a better time, Sir Walter,\\r\\nfor having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.\\r\\nMany a noble fortune has been made during the war.  If a rich admiral\\r\\nwere to come in our way, Sir Walter--\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter;\\r\\n\"that\\'s all I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall\\r\\nbe to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken\\r\\never so many before; hey, Shepherd?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,\\r\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little knowledge\\r\\nof their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they\\r\\nhave very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\r\\nas any set of people one should meet with.  Therefore, Sir Walter,\\r\\nwhat I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of\\r\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated\\r\\nas a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep\\r\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\r\\nand curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd,\\r\\nmight conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it\\r\\nworth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him\\r\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much\\r\\nI venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,\\r\\nwith all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;\\r\\nin the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications\\r\\nwill unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy\\r\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,\\r\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you\\r\\nthe trouble of replying.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,\\r\\nhe observed sarcastically--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would\\r\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her over,\\r\\nnothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay\\'s health as a drive to Kellynch:\\r\\n\"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\r\\na very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the profession;\\r\\nand besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\\r\\nin all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter,\\r\\nif you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in\\r\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of!\\r\\nThe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\r\\nas they are now.  You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own\\r\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced\\r\\nto let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\r\\nto be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.\\r\\nThe park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,\\r\\nor men of any other description, can have had such a range;\\r\\nbut what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,\\r\\nis another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\r\\nalways approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard\\r\\nwith respect to her flower garden.  I am very little disposed\\r\\nto grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour,\\r\\nI assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"In all these cases, there are established usages which\\r\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.\\r\\nYour interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me\\r\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.\\r\\nI venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous\\r\\nfor his own, as John Shepherd will be for him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHere Anne spoke--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least\\r\\nan equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and\\r\\nall the privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough\\r\\nfor their comforts, we must all allow.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\"\\r\\nwas Mr Shepherd\\'s rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter\\'s;\\r\\nbut Sir Walter\\'s remark was, soon afterwards--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see\\r\\nany friend of mine belonging to it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds\\r\\nof objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons\\r\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours\\r\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,\\r\\nas it cuts up a man\\'s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\\r\\nsooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.\\r\\nA man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\r\\nof one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,\\r\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in\\r\\nany other line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company\\r\\nwith two men, striking instances of what I am talking of;\\r\\nLord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,\\r\\nwithout bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives,\\r\\nand a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage\\r\\nyou can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged\\r\\nto the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,\\r\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top.  \\'In the name of heaven,\\r\\nwho is that old fellow?\\' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near,\\r\\n(Sir Basil Morley).  \\'Old fellow!\\' cried Sir Basil, \\'it is Admiral Baldwin.\\r\\nWhat do you take his age to be?\\'  \\'Sixty,\\' said I, \\'or perhaps sixty-two.\\'\\r\\n\\'Forty,\\' replied Sir Basil, \\'forty, and no more.\\'  Picture to yourselves\\r\\nmy amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.\\r\\nI never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;\\r\\nbut to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:  they are all\\r\\nknocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,\\r\\ntill they are not fit to be seen.  It is a pity they are not knocked\\r\\non the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin\\'s age.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed.\\r\\nHave a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.\\r\\nThe sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;\\r\\nI have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then,\\r\\nis not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?\\r\\nSoldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in\\r\\nthe quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,\\r\\nif not of the body, which seldom leaves a man\\'s looks to the natural\\r\\neffect of time.  The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician\\r\\nis up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even\\r\\nthe clergyman--\" she stopt a moment to consider what might\\r\\ndo for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged\\r\\nto go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to\\r\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In fact, as I have\\r\\nlong been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable\\r\\nin its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,\\r\\nwho can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,\\r\\nfollowing their own pursuits, and living on their own property,\\r\\nwithout the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,\\r\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:\\r\\nI know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\r\\nwhen they cease to be quite young.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak\\r\\nSir Walter\\'s good will towards a naval officer as tenant,\\r\\nhad been gifted with foresight; for the very first application\\r\\nfor the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards\\r\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed,\\r\\nhe had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.\\r\\nBy the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,\\r\\nAdmiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired\\r\\na very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,\\r\\nand had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\r\\nin that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;\\r\\nthat accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,\\r\\nMr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter\\'s concerns could not be kept a\\r\\nsecret,)--accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,\\r\\nand understanding his (Mr Shepherd\\'s) connection with the owner,\\r\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,\\r\\nand had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong\\r\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\r\\ncould feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,\\r\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter\\'s cold suspicious inquiry.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman\\'s family,\\r\\nand mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,\\r\\nadded--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,\\r\\nand has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,\\r\\nI believe, several years.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face\\r\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,\\r\\nhearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,\\r\\nbut not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;\\r\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted\\r\\na comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;\\r\\nknew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished\\r\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised\\r\\nif Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;\\r\\nwould be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;\\r\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all\\r\\nthe circumstances of the Admiral\\'s family, which made him\\r\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant.  He was a married man,\\r\\nand without children; the very state to be wished for.  A house was\\r\\nnever taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady:\\r\\nhe did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\r\\nas much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.\\r\\nA lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture\\r\\nin the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton\\r\\nwith the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were\\r\\ntalking the matter over.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\\r\\ncontinued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms, and\\r\\ntaxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with\\r\\nbusiness; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite\\r\\nunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to\\r\\nsay, she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she\\r\\ntold me so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back\\r\\nat Monkford. Bless me! what was his name? At this moment I cannot\\r\\nrecollect his name, though I have heard it so lately.

Very odd indeed!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter waiting another moment--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Shepherd was all gratitude.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.\\r\\nHe had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,\\r\\nfor two or three years.

Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.\\r\\nYou misled me by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of\\r\\nsome man of property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;\\r\\nquite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.\\r\\nOne wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them\\r\\nno service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,\\r\\nwith all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\r\\nin their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea\\r\\nthey had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for\\r\\nthe advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked\\r\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:\\r\\nan extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in\\r\\nthe secret of Sir Walter\\'s estimate of the dues of a tenant.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with\\r\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\\r\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms,\\r\\nhe was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty,\\r\\nand authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained\\r\\nat Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough\\r\\nof the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,\\r\\nin all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.\\r\\nSo far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little\\r\\nadditional soothing, in the Admiral\\'s situation in life, which was just\\r\\nhigh enough, and not too high.  \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\"\\r\\nwould sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;\\r\\na Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs\\r\\na note of explanation.

He was, at that time, a remarkably fine\\r\\nyoung man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;\\r\\nand Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,\\r\\nand feeling.  Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have\\r\\nbeen enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love;\\r\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.\\r\\nThey were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and\\r\\ndeeply in love.  It would be difficult to say which had seen\\r\\nhighest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:\\r\\nshe, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in\\r\\nhaving them accepted.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.\\r\\nTroubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually\\r\\nwithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all\\r\\nthe negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,\\r\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.\\r\\nHe thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with\\r\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,\\r\\nto throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen\\r\\nin an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself\\r\\nto recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances\\r\\nof a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure\\r\\neven his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away,\\r\\nwhich she grieved to think of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few,\\r\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;\\r\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,\\r\\nyouth-killing dependence!  It must not be, if by any fair interference\\r\\nof friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother\\'s love,\\r\\nand mother\\'s rights, it would be prevented.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;\\r\\nbut spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.\\r\\nBut he was confident that he should soon be rich:\\r\\nfull of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,\\r\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.\\r\\nHe had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.\\r\\nSuch confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in\\r\\nthe wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne;\\r\\nbut Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His sanguine temper,\\r\\nand fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.\\r\\nShe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a\\r\\ndangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.\\r\\nLady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching\\r\\nto imprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSuch opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than\\r\\nAnne could combat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet\\r\\nhave been possible to withstand her father\\'s ill-will,\\r\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;\\r\\nbut Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,\\r\\nwith such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,\\r\\nbe continually advising her in vain.  She was persuaded to believe\\r\\nthe engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable\\r\\nof success, and not deserving it.  But it was not a merely selfish caution,\\r\\nunder which she acted, in putting an end to it.  Had she not\\r\\nimagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,\\r\\nshe could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being prudent,\\r\\nand self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,\\r\\nunder the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation\\r\\nwas required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,\\r\\non his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself\\r\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He had left the country\\r\\nin consequence.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;\\r\\nbut not with a few months ended Anne\\'s share of suffering from it.\\r\\nHer attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every\\r\\nenjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\r\\nhad been their lasting effect.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMore than seven years were gone since this little history\\r\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had\\r\\nsoftened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,\\r\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given\\r\\nin change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture),\\r\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society.  No one had ever\\r\\ncome within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with\\r\\nFrederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.  No second attachment,\\r\\nthe only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,\\r\\nat her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,\\r\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society\\r\\naround them.  She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,\\r\\nto change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found\\r\\na more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had\\r\\nlamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man,\\r\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country,\\r\\nonly to Sir Walter\\'s, and of good character and appearance;\\r\\nand however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more,\\r\\nwhile Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two\\r\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\r\\nher father\\'s house, and settled so permanently near herself.\\r\\nBut in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do;\\r\\nand though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,\\r\\nnever wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety\\r\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for Anne\\'s being tempted, by some man\\r\\nof talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her\\r\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey knew not each other\\'s opinion, either its constancy or its change,\\r\\non the one leading point of Anne\\'s conduct, for the subject was never\\r\\nalluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently\\r\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blame\\r\\nLady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\\r\\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,\\r\\nto apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such\\r\\ncertain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.\\r\\nShe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,\\r\\nand every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,\\r\\ndelays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman\\r\\nin maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\\r\\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\\r\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\\r\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which,\\r\\nas it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\r\\ncould be reasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations,\\r\\nall his confidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour\\r\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.\\r\\nHe had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:\\r\\nand all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.\\r\\nHe had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,\\r\\nand must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.\\r\\nShe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,\\r\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,\\r\\nshe had no reason to believe him married.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHow eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,\\r\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\\r\\nconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which\\r\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced\\r\\ninto prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:\\r\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,\\r\\nshe could not hear that Captain Wentworth\\'s sister was likely\\r\\nto live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,\\r\\nand many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.\\r\\nShe often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves\\r\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts\\r\\nand their business no evil.  She was assisted, however, by that\\r\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three\\r\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny\\r\\nany recollection of it.  She could do justice to the superiority\\r\\nof Lady Russell\\'s motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;\\r\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;\\r\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\r\\nfrom whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft\\'s really\\r\\ntaking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\r\\nhad always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to\\r\\nthose three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,\\r\\nshe believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,\\r\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing, had received\\r\\nany information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother had been\\r\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,\\r\\na single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature\\'s\\r\\nhaving heard of it from him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying\\r\\nher husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary,\\r\\nhad been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by\\r\\nthe pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge\\r\\nof it afterwards.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\r\\nand the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,\\r\\nand Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,\\r\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap05\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOn the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s seeing Kellynch Hall,\\r\\nAnne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell\\'s,\\r\\nand keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural\\r\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,\\r\\nand decided the whole business at once.  Each lady was previously\\r\\nwell disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,\\r\\nbut good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,\\r\\nthere was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality\\r\\non the Admiral\\'s side, as could not but influence Sir Walter,\\r\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\r\\nbehaviour by Mr Shepherd\\'s assurances of his being known, by report,\\r\\nto the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts\\r\\nwere approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;\\r\\nand Mr Shepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been\\r\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\r\\n\"This indenture sheweth.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be\\r\\nthe best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\\r\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,\\r\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;\\r\\nand the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife\\r\\nas they drove back through the park, \"I thought we should soon\\r\\ncome to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.\\r\\nThe Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be\\r\\nno harm in him.\"--reciprocal compliments, which would have been\\r\\nesteemed about equal.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter\\r\\nproposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,\\r\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use,\\r\\nor any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\\r\\ngoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\\r\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\r\\nconvey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements\\r\\nof her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks,\\r\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne\\r\\nthough dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare\\r\\nof Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\r\\nof the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,\\r\\neverything considered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right,\\r\\nand most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering\\r\\nto go with the others.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty.\\r\\nMary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal\\r\\nof her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne\\r\\nwhen anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing\\r\\nthat she should not have a day\\'s health all the autumn, entreated,\\r\\nor rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to\\r\\nUppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,\\r\\ninstead of going to Bath.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary\\'s reasoning;\\r\\nand Elizabeth\\'s reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay,\\r\\nfor nobody will want her in Bath.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTo be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\\r\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to\\r\\nbe thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,\\r\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,\\r\\nand her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis invitation of Mary\\'s removed all Lady Russell\\'s difficulties,\\r\\nand it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath\\r\\ntill Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time\\r\\nshould be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSo far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled\\r\\nby the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,\\r\\nwhich was, Mrs Clay\\'s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter\\r\\nand Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\r\\nin all the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry\\r\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,\\r\\ngrieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,\\r\\nin Mrs Clay\\'s being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,\\r\\nwas a very sore aggravation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt\\r\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.\\r\\nWith a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,\\r\\nwhich she often wished less, of her father\\'s character, she was\\r\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\r\\nwere more than possible.  She did not imagine that her father\\r\\nhad at present an idea of the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles,\\r\\nand a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually\\r\\nmaking severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,\\r\\nand certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind\\r\\nand assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions\\r\\nthan any merely personal might have been.  Anne was so impressed\\r\\nby the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself\\r\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  She had little hope\\r\\nof success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be\\r\\nso much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,\\r\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive\\r\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly\\r\\nanswered for each party\\'s perfectly knowing their situation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is;\\r\\nand as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,\\r\\nI can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are\\r\\nparticularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\r\\nand rank more strongly than most people.  And as to my father,\\r\\nI really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single\\r\\nso long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were\\r\\na very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her\\r\\nso much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure,\\r\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might\\r\\nbe rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits,\\r\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor\\r\\nMrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  One would imagine\\r\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,\\r\\nthough I know you must fifty times.  That tooth of her\\'s\\r\\nand those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\\r\\nas they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,\\r\\nbut he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice\\r\\nMrs Clay\\'s freckles.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne,\\r\\n\"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly;\\r\\n\"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never\\r\\nalter plain ones.  However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more\\r\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it\\r\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless\\r\\nof doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,\\r\\nmight yet be made observant by it.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,\\r\\nMiss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. The party drove off in very good\\r\\nspirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the\\r\\nafflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show\\r\\nthemselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate\\r\\ntranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt this\\r\\nbreak-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was\\r\\nas dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become\\r\\nprecious by habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,\\r\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;\\r\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,\\r\\nand be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived,\\r\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\r\\nwhen she must give up Anne.  Accordingly their removal was made together,\\r\\nand Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage\\r\\nof Lady Russell\\'s journey.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nUppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back\\r\\nhad been completely in the old English style, containing only\\r\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;\\r\\nthe mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\\r\\nsubstantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\\r\\nenclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree\\r\\ntrained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young \\'squire,\\r\\nit had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,\\r\\nfor his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,\\r\\nFrench windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch\\r\\nthe traveller\\'s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\r\\nand premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHere Anne had often been staying. She knew the ways of Uppercross as\\r\\nwell as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually\\r\\nmeeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other\\'s\\r\\nhouse at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary\\r\\nalone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\r\\na matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary\\r\\nhad not Anne\\'s understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and\\r\\nproperly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\\r\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources for\\r\\nsolitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\\r\\nself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of\\r\\nfancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior\\r\\nto both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity\\r\\nof being \"a fine girl.\" She was now lying on the faded sofa of the\\r\\npretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had\\r\\nbeen gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and\\r\\ntwo children; and, on Anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.\\r\\nI am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature\\r\\nthe whole morning!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me\\r\\nsuch a good account of yourself on Thursday!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well\\r\\nat the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life\\r\\nas I have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.\\r\\nSuppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,\\r\\nand not able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.\\r\\nI do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.\\r\\n\"Oh! Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o\\'clock.\\r\\nHe would go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not\\r\\nstay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.\\r\\nI assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You have had your little boys with you?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\\r\\nthat they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind\\r\\na word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully.\\r\\n\"You know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours\\r\\nat the Great House?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them to-day,\\r\\nexcept Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,\\r\\nbut without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,\\r\\nnot one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to suit\\r\\nthe Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves\\r\\nout of their way.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.\\r\\nIt is early.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal\\r\\ntoo much for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind\\r\\nof you not to come on Thursday.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!\\r\\nYou wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,\\r\\nand in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware\\r\\nthat my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:\\r\\nand besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy,\\r\\nhave had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have\\r\\nleft Kellynch sooner.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect\\r\\nin a moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making\\r\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my father\\'s books and pictures.\\r\\nI have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,\\r\\ntrying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth\\'s plants\\r\\nare for Lady Russell.  I have had all my own little concerns\\r\\nto arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,\\r\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:\\r\\nand one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature:\\r\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.\\r\\nI was told that they wished it.  But all these things took up\\r\\na great deal of time.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! well!\" and after a moment\\'s pause, \"but you have never asked me\\r\\none word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded\\r\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all\\r\\nthe matter with me till this morning.  It would have been strange\\r\\nif I had not gone.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,\\r\\nand who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\r\\na carriage of one\\'s own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were\\r\\nso crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room;\\r\\nand Mr Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into\\r\\nthe back seat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely\\r\\nthat my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\r\\non Anne\\'s side produced nearly a cure on Mary\\'s.  She could soon\\r\\nsit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able\\r\\nto leave it by dinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it,\\r\\nshe was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;\\r\\nthen, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough\\r\\nto propose a little walk.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose\\r\\nyou will not like to call at the Great House before they have\\r\\nbeen to see you?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne.\\r\\n\"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know\\r\\nso well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.\\r\\nThey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However,\\r\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we\\r\\nhave that over, we can enjoy our walk.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\\r\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\\r\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence,\\r\\nneither family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly\\r\\nthey went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\\r\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present\\r\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\r\\nby a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables\\r\\nplaced in every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits\\r\\nagainst the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\r\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious\\r\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves\\r\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\\r\\nperhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old\\r\\nEnglish style, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\r\\nwere a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,\\r\\nnot much educated, and not at all elegant.  Their children had\\r\\nmore modern minds and manners.  There was a numerous family;\\r\\nbut the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa,\\r\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter\\r\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands\\r\\nof other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.\\r\\nTheir dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,\\r\\ntheir spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;\\r\\nthey were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.\\r\\nAnne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\r\\nof her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some\\r\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\r\\nof exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant\\r\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing\\r\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,\\r\\nthat good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\\r\\nso little herself with either of her sisters.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss\\r\\non the side of the Great House family, which was generally,\\r\\nas Anne very well knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was\\r\\nchatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised,\\r\\nat the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both\\r\\nthe Miss Musgroves, at Mary\\'s particular invitation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap06\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal\\r\\nfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,\\r\\nwill often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.\\r\\nShe had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,\\r\\nor without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage\\r\\nin seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs\\r\\nwhich at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity\\r\\nand pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed\\r\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing\\r\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;\\r\\nfor certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject\\r\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,\\r\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\r\\nin the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove:\\r\\n\"So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath\\r\\ndo you think they will settle in?\" and this, without much\\r\\nwaiting for an answer; or in the young ladies\\' addition of,\\r\\n\"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa,\\r\\nif we do go, we must be in a good situation:  none of your\\r\\nQueen Squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from Mary,\\r\\nof--\"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away\\r\\nto be happy at Bath!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,\\r\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\r\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,\\r\\ntheir own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females\\r\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,\\r\\nneighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be\\r\\nvery fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\r\\nits own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become\\r\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.\\r\\nWith the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,\\r\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,\\r\\nand all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive\\r\\nand unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\\r\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\r\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms\\r\\nwith her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,\\r\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had\\r\\nan object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\\r\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\\r\\nor grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,\\r\\nat all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,\\r\\nAnne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match\\r\\nmight have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding\\r\\nmight have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,\\r\\nrationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was,\\r\\nhe did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise\\r\\ntrifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.\\r\\nHe had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by\\r\\nhis wife\\'s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness\\r\\nsometimes to Anne\\'s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was\\r\\nvery often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share\\r\\nthan she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass\\r\\nfor a happy couple.  They were always perfectly agreed in the want\\r\\nof more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\r\\nfrom his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,\\r\\nfor while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,\\r\\nhe always contended for his father\\'s having many other uses for his money,\\r\\nand a right to spend it as he liked.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs to the management of their children, his theory was much better\\r\\nthan his wife\\'s, and his practice not so bad.  \"I could manage them\\r\\nvery well, if it were not for Mary\\'s interference,\" was what\\r\\nAnne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;\\r\\nbut when listening in turn to Mary\\'s reproach of \"Charles spoils\\r\\nthe children so that I cannot get them into any order,\" she never had\\r\\nthe smallest temptation to say, \"Very true.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOne of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\r\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,\\r\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.\\r\\nKnown to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,\\r\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.\\r\\n\"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\"\\r\\nwas Charles\\'s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary:\\r\\n\"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think\\r\\nthere was anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would,\\r\\nyou might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse\\r\\nthan I ever own.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMary\\'s declaration was, \"I hate sending the children to the Great House,\\r\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours\\r\\nand indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash\\r\\nand sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\r\\nfor the rest of the day.\"  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity\\r\\nof being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing\\r\\nMrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.\\r\\nThey are quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure,\\r\\nin general they are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister\\r\\nin the way of managing them.  They are as fine healthy children\\r\\nas ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;\\r\\nbut Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!\\r\\nBless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne,\\r\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\r\\nI otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased\\r\\nwith my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad\\r\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\r\\nevery moment; \"don\\'t do this,\" and \"don\\'t do that;\" or that one can\\r\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks\\r\\nall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason\\r\\nto call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration,\\r\\nthat her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being\\r\\nin their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.\\r\\nI meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery\\r\\nwithout seeing something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest,\\r\\nsteadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;\\r\\nfor she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\"\\r\\nAnd on Mrs Musgrove\\'s side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering\\r\\nin any of my daughter-in-law\\'s concerns, for I know it would not do;\\r\\nbut I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things\\r\\nto rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles\\'s nursery-maid:\\r\\nI hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from\\r\\nmy own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,\\r\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.\\r\\nMrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,\\r\\nthat you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,\\r\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAgain, it was Mary\\'s complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt\\r\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined\\r\\nat the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason\\r\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.\\r\\nAnd one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them\\r\\nafter talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,\\r\\n\"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are\\r\\nabout their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\r\\nyou are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that\\r\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,\\r\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\r\\nplace of mamma.  Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,\\r\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.\\r\\nIt is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,\\r\\nbut I know it is taken notice of by many persons.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHow was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little more\\r\\nthan listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each\\r\\nto the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\r\\nbetween such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest\\r\\nwhich were meant for her sister\\'s benefit.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.\\r\\nHer own spirits improved by change of place and subject,\\r\\nby being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary\\'s ailments lessened\\r\\nby having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse\\r\\nwith the other family, since there was neither superior affection,\\r\\nconfidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,\\r\\nwas rather an advantage.  It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,\\r\\nfor they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;\\r\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\r\\nof Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s respectable forms in the usual places,\\r\\nor without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,\\r\\nbut having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,\\r\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was\\r\\nlittle thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,\\r\\nas she was well aware.  She knew that when she played she was\\r\\ngiving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.\\r\\nExcepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age\\r\\nof fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness\\r\\nof being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.\\r\\nIn music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;\\r\\nand Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s fond partiality for their own daughters\\'\\r\\nperformance, and total indifference to any other person\\'s,\\r\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification\\r\\nfor her own.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.\\r\\nThe neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited\\r\\nby everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,\\r\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.\\r\\nThey were more completely popular.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\\r\\nin an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins\\r\\nwithin a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,\\r\\nwho depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come\\r\\nat any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne,\\r\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,\\r\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which\\r\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\r\\nmore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\"Well\\r\\ndone, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!\\r\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSo passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne\\'s heart\\r\\nmust be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others;\\r\\nall the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,\\r\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  She could not\\r\\nthink of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this\\r\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion\\r\\nto note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this\\r\\nthe day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?  I am glad I did not\\r\\nthink of it before.  How low it makes me!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were\\r\\nto be visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.\\r\\n\"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.  She should put it off\\r\\nas long as she could;\" but was not easy till she had talked Charles\\r\\ninto driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,\\r\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.\\r\\nAnne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.\\r\\nShe wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within\\r\\nwhen the visit was returned.  They came:  the master of the house\\r\\nwas not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced\\r\\nthat Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary,\\r\\nand made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice\\r\\nof her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,\\r\\nand if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,\\r\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,\\r\\nuprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.\\r\\nShe had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;\\r\\nthough her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence\\r\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to\\r\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\\r\\nHer manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had\\r\\nno distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any\\r\\napproach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.\\r\\nAnne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration\\r\\ntowards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her:\\r\\nespecially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,\\r\\nin the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest\\r\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft\\'s side, to give a bias\\r\\nof any sort.  She was quite easy on that head, and consequently\\r\\nfull of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by\\r\\nMrs Croft\\'s suddenly saying,--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had\\r\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\\r\\nshe certainly had not.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,\\r\\nwhen Mrs Croft\\'s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth\\r\\nof whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do\\r\\nfor either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,\\r\\nthat Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward,\\r\\nand not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\r\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour\\'s\\r\\npresent state with proper interest.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,\\r\\nshe heard the Admiral say to Mary--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft\\'s here soon; I dare say\\r\\nyou know him by name.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,\\r\\nclinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;\\r\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\r\\nin his coat pockets, &amp;c., to have another moment for finishing\\r\\nor recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,\\r\\nas well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.\\r\\nShe could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,\\r\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\r\\nat the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day\\r\\nat the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\r\\nto be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,\\r\\nwhen the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming\\r\\nto apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,\\r\\nwas the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,\\r\\nwhen Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,\\r\\nto leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.\\r\\nI am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are\\r\\nout of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much\\r\\nof poor Richard!  And we agreed it would be best to have the harp,\\r\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you\\r\\nwhy she is out of spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning,\\r\\n(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,\\r\\nthat her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England,\\r\\nor paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;\\r\\nand most unluckily it came into mamma\\'s head, when they were gone,\\r\\nthat Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of\\r\\npoor Richard\\'s captain at one time; I do not know when or where,\\r\\nbut a great while before he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over\\r\\nhis letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure\\r\\nthat this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,\\r\\nand of poor Richard!  So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not\\r\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\\r\\nthat the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\\r\\nhopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\r\\nhis twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\r\\nand unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for\\r\\nat any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;\\r\\nseldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence\\r\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,\\r\\nby calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed,\\r\\nunfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything\\r\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\\r\\nliving or dead.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals\\r\\nto which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen\\r\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board\\r\\nCaptain Frederick Wentworth\\'s frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia\\r\\nhe had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters\\r\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\r\\nof his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;\\r\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,\\r\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,\\r\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,\\r\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove\\r\\nshould have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection\\r\\nof the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those\\r\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;\\r\\nand the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,\\r\\nher poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,\\r\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into\\r\\ngreater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death.\\r\\nMr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when\\r\\nthey reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,\\r\\nof being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,\\r\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTo hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name\\r\\nso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,\\r\\nthat it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth\\r\\nwhom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back\\r\\nfrom Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether\\r\\nit was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne\\'s nerves.\\r\\nShe found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.\\r\\nSince he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself\\r\\nto be insensible on such points.  And not only did it appear that\\r\\nhe was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude\\r\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect\\r\\nfor his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick\\'s having been\\r\\nsix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,\\r\\nthough not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow,\\r\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on\\r\\nintroducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as\\r\\nthey could hear of his arrival.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap07\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch,\\r\\nand Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,\\r\\nand he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross,\\r\\nby the end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment\\r\\nto Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,\\r\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth\\r\\nunder his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\r\\nand best in his cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week,\\r\\nin Anne\\'s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;\\r\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove\\'s civility,\\r\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour.\\r\\nShe and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,\\r\\nwhere, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,\\r\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boy\\'s being at that moment\\r\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall.  The child\\'s situation\\r\\nput the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape\\r\\nwith indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\r\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury\\r\\nreceived in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.\\r\\nIt was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once;\\r\\nthe apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,\\r\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,\\r\\nthe youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend\\r\\nand soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,\\r\\nproper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession\\r\\nrather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer brother\\'s return was the first comfort; he could take best care\\r\\nof his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\\r\\nTill he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were\\r\\nthe worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\\r\\nbut now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson\\r\\nfelt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words\\r\\nboth to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,\\r\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;\\r\\nand then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts\\r\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephew\\'s state, as to give\\r\\nthe information of Captain Wentworth\\'s visit; staying five minutes behind\\r\\ntheir father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\r\\nthey were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable\\r\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,\\r\\nwho had been at all a favourite before.  How glad they had been\\r\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said\\r\\nit was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised\\r\\nin reply to papa and mamma\\'s farther pressing invitations to come\\r\\nand dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;\\r\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt\\r\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought.  And in short,\\r\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,\\r\\nthat they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;\\r\\nand off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently\\r\\nmore full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came\\r\\nwith their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;\\r\\nand Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,\\r\\ncould add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now\\r\\nno occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think\\r\\nthat the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,\\r\\nto give him the meeting.  \"Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\"\\r\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\r\\nto bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape,\\r\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;\\r\\n\"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced\\r\\nto Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;\\r\\nhe would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\"\\r\\nBut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed,\\r\\nCharles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything\\r\\nshould happen?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.\\r\\nIt must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\r\\ndone to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,\\r\\nand Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity\\r\\nfor longer confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused\\r\\nas quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?\\r\\nThis was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,\\r\\nwho could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  His father\\r\\nvery much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being\\r\\nno sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his\\r\\nmaking a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,\\r\\nof his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;\\r\\n\"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me\\r\\nquite right.  Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.\\r\\nYou would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.\\r\\nAnne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\\r\\nMary knew, from Charles\\'s manner of speaking, that he was\\r\\nquite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.\\r\\nShe said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,\\r\\nbut as soon as there was only Anne to hear--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this\\r\\npoor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!\\r\\nI knew how it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is\\r\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,\\r\\nand Charles is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say\\r\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.\\r\\nTalks of his being going on so well!  How does he know that he is\\r\\ngoing on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?\\r\\nI did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to\\r\\ngo away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother,\\r\\nI am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit\\r\\nthan anybody else to be about the child.  My being the mother\\r\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all\\r\\nequal to it.  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of\\r\\nthe shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have\\r\\nnothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson\\'s directions,\\r\\nand have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.\\r\\nNursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.\\r\\nA sick child is always the mother\\'s property:  her own feelings\\r\\ngenerally make it so.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know\\r\\nthat I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles,\\r\\nfor I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;\\r\\nand you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,\\r\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about.  I have not nerves\\r\\nfor the sort of thing.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending\\r\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so careful;\\r\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really think\\r\\nCharles might as well have told his father we would all come.\\r\\nI am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.\\r\\nI was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\\r\\nsuppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles\\r\\nto my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain\\r\\nwith him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  \"Dear me!\\r\\nthat\\'s a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure,\\r\\nI may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?\\r\\nand it only harasses me.  You, who have not a mother\\'s feelings,\\r\\nare a great deal the properest person.  You can make little Charles\\r\\ndo anything; he always minds you at a word.  It will be a great deal better\\r\\nthan leaving him only with Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go;\\r\\nI am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me\\r\\nexcessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know\\r\\nyou do not mind being left alone.  An excellent thought of yours,\\r\\nindeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.\\r\\nYou can send for us, you know, at a moment\\'s notice, if anything\\r\\nis the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.\\r\\nI should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease\\r\\nabout my dear child.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe next moment she was tapping at her husband\\'s dressing-room door,\\r\\nand as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for\\r\\nthe whole conversation, which began with Mary\\'s saying,\\r\\nin a tone of great exultation--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home\\r\\nthan you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,\\r\\nI should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.\\r\\nAnne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.\\r\\nIt is Anne\\'s own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be\\r\\na great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband\\'s answer, \"and I should be\\r\\nvery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\\r\\nleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity\\r\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction\\r\\nwas at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being\\r\\nleft to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\\r\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her\\r\\nto let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;\\r\\nand this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\r\\nset off together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped,\\r\\nto be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;\\r\\nas for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,\\r\\nas were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  She knew herself to be\\r\\nof the first utility to the child; and what was it to her\\r\\nif Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself\\r\\nagreeable to others?\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.\\r\\nPerhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.\\r\\nHe must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished\\r\\never to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;\\r\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\r\\nshe should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him\\r\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\\r\\nand their visit in general.  There had been music, singing,\\r\\ntalking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners\\r\\nin Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all\\r\\nto know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning\\r\\nto shoot with Charles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage,\\r\\nthough that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed\\r\\nto come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being\\r\\nin Mrs Charles Musgrove\\'s way, on account of the child, and therefore,\\r\\nsomehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles\\'s being to meet him\\r\\nto breakfast at his father\\'s.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired\\r\\nafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,\\r\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,\\r\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those\\r\\nof the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great\\r\\nthat Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\r\\nCharles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was\\r\\ncome for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth;\\r\\nhis sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth\\r\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;\\r\\nand though Charles had answered for the child\\'s being in no such state\\r\\nas could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied\\r\\nwithout his running on to give notice.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,\\r\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was\\r\\nthe most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.\\r\\nIn two minutes after Charles\\'s preparation, the others appeared;\\r\\nthey were in the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth\\'s,\\r\\na bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary,\\r\\nsaid all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,\\r\\nenough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons\\r\\nand voices, but a few minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself\\r\\nat the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,\\r\\nthe Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk\\r\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen:  the room was cleared,\\r\\nand Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again,\\r\\nin nervous gratitude.  \"The worst is over!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.\\r\\nThey had met.  They had been once more in the same room.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.\\r\\nEight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.\\r\\nHow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\r\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not\\r\\neight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,\\r\\nremovals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\\r\\nhow natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part\\r\\nof her own life.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAlas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\\r\\neight years may be little more than nothing.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nNow, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like\\r\\nwishing to avoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself\\r\\nfor the folly which asked the question.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOn one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\r\\nmight not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;\\r\\nfor, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\r\\nat the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary:--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was\\r\\nso attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,\\r\\nwhen they went away, and he said, \\'You were so altered he should not\\r\\nhave known you again.\\'\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMary had no feelings to make her respect her sister\\'s in a common way,\\r\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Altered beyond his knowledge.\"  Anne fully submitted, in silent,\\r\\ndeep mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,\\r\\nfor he was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already\\r\\nacknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,\\r\\nlet him think of her as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed\\r\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,\\r\\nopen look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.\\r\\nShe had seen the same Frederick Wentworth.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"So altered that he should not have known her again!\"  These were words\\r\\nwhich could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice\\r\\nthat she had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency;\\r\\nthey allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must\\r\\nmake her happier.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nFrederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,\\r\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her.\\r\\nHe had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,\\r\\nhad spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.\\r\\nShe had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,\\r\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,\\r\\nconfident temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.\\r\\nIt had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been\\r\\nweakness and timidity.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since\\r\\nwhom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation\\r\\nof curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her power with him\\r\\nwas gone for ever.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned on shore,\\r\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;\\r\\nactually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed\\r\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart\\r\\nfor either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,\\r\\nin short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,\\r\\nexcepting Anne Elliot.  This was his only secret exception,\\r\\nwhen he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.\\r\\nAnybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.\\r\\nA little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,\\r\\nand I am a lost man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor,\\r\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye\\r\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was\\r\\nnot out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described\\r\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with.  \"A strong mind,\\r\\nwith sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"That is the woman I want,\" said he.  \"Something a little inferior\\r\\nI shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,\\r\\nI shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject\\r\\nmore than most men.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap08\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nFrom this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly\\r\\nin the same circle.  They were soon dining in company together\\r\\nat Mr Musgrove\\'s, for the little boy\\'s state could no longer\\r\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was\\r\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;\\r\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;\\r\\nthey could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\\r\\ncould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\\r\\nwhich conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him,\\r\\nhis disposition lead him, to talk; and \"That was in the year six;\"\\r\\n\"That happened before I went to sea in the year six,\" occurred\\r\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together:\\r\\nand though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason\\r\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,\\r\\nAnne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,\\r\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.\\r\\nThere must be the same immediate association of thought,\\r\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what\\r\\nthe commonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!\\r\\nNow nothing!  There had been a time, when of all the large party\\r\\nnow filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it\\r\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another.  With the exception,\\r\\nperhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached\\r\\nand happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\r\\nthe married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,\\r\\nno tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.\\r\\nNow they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could\\r\\nnever become acquainted.  It was a perpetual estrangement.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\\r\\nThere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;\\r\\nand he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,\\r\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner\\r\\nof living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &amp;c., and their surprise\\r\\nat his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\r\\nwhich was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,\\r\\nwhich reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,\\r\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\r\\nwithout anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,\\r\\nor any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nFrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper\\r\\nof Mrs Musgrove\\'s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son,\\r\\nI dare say he would have been just such another by this time.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove\\r\\nrelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\\r\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhen she could let her attention take its natural course again,\\r\\nshe found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List\\r\\n(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),\\r\\nand sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view\\r\\nof finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.\\r\\nI was the last man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.\\r\\nReported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off\\r\\nto the West Indies.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe girls looked all amazement.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The Admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then,\\r\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\\r\\nBut they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands\\r\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible\\r\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\\r\\nNever was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built sloop,\\r\\nyou would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows there\\r\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\r\\nat the same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,\\r\\nwith no more interest than his.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;\" replied Captain Wentworth,\\r\\nseriously.  \"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.\\r\\nIt was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;\\r\\na very great object, I wanted to be doing something.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore\\r\\nfor half a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants\\r\\nto be afloat again.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\\r\\nwhen you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\\r\\n\"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\r\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen\\r\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,\\r\\nand which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.\\r\\nAh! she was a dear old Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.\\r\\nI knew she would.  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together,\\r\\nor that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days\\r\\nof foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after\\r\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck\\r\\nin my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate\\r\\nI wanted.  I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.\\r\\nWe had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,\\r\\nwhich lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for\\r\\npoor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation\\r\\nnot having much improved our condition.  Four-and-twenty hours later,\\r\\nand I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,\\r\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost\\r\\nin only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" Anne\\'s shudderings\\r\\nwere to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open\\r\\nas they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice,\\r\\nas if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there\\r\\nhe met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her),\\r\\n\"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.\\r\\nI always forgot.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar,\\r\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid\\r\\nof mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure\\r\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\\r\\nonly nodded in reply, and walked away.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth\\r\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\r\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud\\r\\nthe little statement of her name and rate, and present\\r\\nnon-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been\\r\\none of the best friends man ever had.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I\\r\\nmade money in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise\\r\\ntogether off the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!\\r\\nYou know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.\\r\\nExcellent fellow.  I shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all,\\r\\nso much for her sake.  I wished for him again the next summer,\\r\\nwhen I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And I am sure, Sir,\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\\r\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget\\r\\nwhat you did.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,\\r\\nhearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all\\r\\nnear his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking\\r\\nof poor Richard.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Poor dear fellow!\" continued Mrs Musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\\r\\nand such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!\\r\\nAh! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.\\r\\nI assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth\\'s face at this speech,\\r\\na certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,\\r\\nwhich convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove\\'s kind wishes,\\r\\nas to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;\\r\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected\\r\\nby any who understood him less than herself; in another moment\\r\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards\\r\\ncoming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting,\\r\\ntook a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,\\r\\nin a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy\\r\\nand natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\r\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parent\\'s feelings.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had\\r\\nmost readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.\\r\\nIt was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of\\r\\na comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature\\r\\nto express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;\\r\\nand while the agitations of Anne\\'s slender form, and pensive face,\\r\\nmay be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth\\r\\nshould be allowed some credit for the self-command with which\\r\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,\\r\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nPersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.\\r\\nA large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,\\r\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair or not fair,\\r\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in\\r\\nvain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\r\\nwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,\\r\\nnow came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation\\r\\nof what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,\\r\\nbegan with--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,\\r\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson\\r\\nand her daughters.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;\\r\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\r\\non board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,\\r\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\\r\\ntowards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,\\r\\nwith all one\\'s efforts, and all one\\'s sacrifices, to make\\r\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have.\\r\\nThere can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women\\r\\nto every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.  I hate to hear\\r\\nof women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command\\r\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis brought his sister upon him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you.--All idle refinement!--Women\\r\\nmay be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.\\r\\nI believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know\\r\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I declare\\r\\nI have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,\"\\r\\n(with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in most of\\r\\nthe ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"You were living\\r\\nwith your husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,\\r\\nand three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this\\r\\nsuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any\\r\\nbrother officer\\'s wife that I could, and I would bring anything\\r\\nof Harville\\'s from the world\\'s end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine\\r\\nthat I did not feel it an evil in itself.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number\\r\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would\\r\\nbecome of us poor sailors\\' wives, who often want to be conveyed to\\r\\none port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville\\r\\nand all her family to Plymouth.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,\\r\\nand as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.\\r\\nWe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ah! my dear,\" said the Admiral, \"when he had got a wife,\\r\\nhe will sing a different tune.  When he is married, if we have\\r\\nthe good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I,\\r\\nand a great many others, have done.  We shall have him very thankful\\r\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ay, that we shall.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth.  \"When once married\\r\\npeople begin to attack me with,--\\'Oh! you will think very differently,\\r\\nwhen you are married.\\'  I can only say, \\'No, I shall not;\\' and then\\r\\nthey say again, \\'Yes, you will,\\' and there is an end of it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe got up and moved away.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"What a great traveller you must have been, ma\\'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove\\r\\nto Mrs Croft.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Pretty well, ma\\'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;\\r\\nthough many women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic\\r\\nfour times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again,\\r\\nand only once; besides being in different places about home:\\r\\nCork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.  But I never went beyond the Streights,\\r\\nand never was in the West Indies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama,\\r\\nyou know, the West Indies.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself\\r\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And I do assure you, ma\\'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can exceed\\r\\nthe accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates.\\r\\nWhen you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;\\r\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;\\r\\nand I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\r\\non board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was nothing\\r\\nto be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with\\r\\nexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little disordered\\r\\nalways the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew\\r\\nwhat sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really suffered\\r\\nin body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,\\r\\nor had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal,\\r\\nwhen the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.\\r\\nI lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\\r\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,\\r\\nor when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,\\r\\nnothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,\\r\\nMrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove\\'s hearty answer.  \"There is nothing so bad\\r\\nas a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is,\\r\\nfor Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when\\r\\nthey are over, and he is safe back again.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed,\\r\\nAnne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes\\r\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad\\r\\nto be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits\\r\\nthan Captain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate\\r\\nhim which general attention and deference, and especially the attention\\r\\nof all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females\\r\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted\\r\\nto the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa,\\r\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but\\r\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves\\r\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.\\r\\nIf he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,\\r\\nwho could wonder?\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThese were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers\\r\\nwere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\\r\\nequally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt\\r\\nthat he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,\\r\\nperhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\r\\ncharmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;\\r\\nshe was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was\\r\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?\\r\\nThe answer was, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.\\r\\nShe had rather play.  She is never tired of playing.\"  Once, too,\\r\\nhe spoke to her.  She had left the instrument on the dancing being over,\\r\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\r\\nto give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned\\r\\nto that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,\\r\\nsaid, with studied politeness--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately\\r\\ndrew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\\r\\nto sit down again.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.\\r\\nHis cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap09\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay\\r\\nas long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of\\r\\nthe Admiral\\'s fraternal kindness as of his wife\\'s.  He had intended,\\r\\non first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,\\r\\nand visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions\\r\\nof Uppercross induced him to put this off.  There was so much\\r\\nof friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching\\r\\nin his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,\\r\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all\\r\\nthe charms and perfections of Edward\\'s wife upon credit a little longer.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves\\r\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly\\r\\nin the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral\\r\\nand Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves\\r\\nin their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\\r\\nin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\\r\\nlately added to their establishment.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth\\r\\namong the Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying,\\r\\nwarm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more\\r\\nthan established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them,\\r\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth\\r\\nvery much in the way.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,\\r\\npleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been\\r\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth\\'s\\r\\nintroduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,\\r\\nwhere residence was not required, lived at his father\\'s house,\\r\\nonly two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home\\r\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\\r\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,\\r\\nand of seeing Captain Wentworth.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money,\\r\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\r\\ntheir degree of consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own,\\r\\nbut it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove\\'s; and while\\r\\nthe Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,\\r\\nthe young Hayters would, from their parents\\' inferior, retired,\\r\\nand unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,\\r\\nhave been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion\\r\\nwith Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen\\r\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior\\r\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride\\r\\non one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness\\r\\nof superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased\\r\\nto improve their cousins.  Charles\\'s attentions to Henrietta\\r\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\\r\\n\"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,\"--and\\r\\nHenrietta did seem to like him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHenrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came;\\r\\nbut from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhich of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was\\r\\nas yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne\\'s observation reached.\\r\\nHenrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits;\\r\\nand she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\r\\nwere most likely to attract him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from\\r\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,\\r\\nand of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything\\r\\nto take its chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\r\\nor remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different\\r\\nat the Cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed\\r\\nto speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above\\r\\nfour or five times in the Miss Musgroves\\' company, and Charles Hayter\\r\\nhad but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions\\r\\nof her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.\\r\\nCharles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing\\r\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what\\r\\nhe had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that\\r\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.\\r\\nHere was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance\\r\\nof what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth\\r\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.\\r\\nOh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Upon my word it would,\" replied Mary.  \"Dear me!  If he should\\r\\nrise to any very great honours!  If he should ever be made a baronet!\\r\\n\\'Lady Wentworth\\' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing,\\r\\nindeed, for Henrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta\\r\\nwould not dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!\\r\\nIt would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much\\r\\nof your new creations.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred\\r\\non the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished\\r\\nto see put an end to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters,\\r\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\r\\nbetween the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta;\\r\\nand considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,\\r\\nshe has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman\\r\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\r\\nto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections\\r\\nto those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?\\r\\nNothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss Musgrove\\r\\nof Uppercross.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\\r\\na regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son,\\r\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Now you are talking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer.\\r\\n\"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has\\r\\na very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from\\r\\nthe Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,\\r\\nthat he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very\\r\\npretty property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than\\r\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,\\r\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country.  I grant you,\\r\\nthat any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,\\r\\nand indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;\\r\\nbut he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop\\r\\ncomes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,\\r\\nand live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,\\r\\nhe will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  No, no;\\r\\nHenrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,\\r\\nand Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as\\r\\nhe was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta\\r\\nmarry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse\\r\\nfor me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth\\r\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt\\r\\nthat he has.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.\\r\\nI wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense\\r\\nto say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.\\r\\nBut Charles is so positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday,\\r\\nfor then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you\\r\\nwould have thought as I did, unless you had been determined\\r\\nto give it against me.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA dinner at Mr Musgrove\\'s had been the occasion when all these things\\r\\nshould have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,\\r\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return\\r\\nof indisposition in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\r\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs to Captain Wentworth\\'s views, she deemed it of more consequence\\r\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\r\\nthe happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,\\r\\nthan that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.\\r\\nEither of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,\\r\\ngood-humoured wife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy\\r\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning\\r\\nyoung woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\r\\nit occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\r\\nof her feelings, the alteration could not be understood too soon.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\r\\nin his cousin\\'s behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him\\r\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\r\\nevery past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\r\\nfrom Uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,\\r\\nwhen such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as\\r\\nthe probable cause.  He had been absent only two Sundays,\\r\\nand when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height\\r\\nof his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,\\r\\nand obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then seemed the object\\r\\nnearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than\\r\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,\\r\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed\\r\\non engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good\\r\\nas he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.\\r\\nThe advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going\\r\\nsix miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;\\r\\nof his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley\\'s\\r\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\r\\nwithout most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa,\\r\\nbut had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came back, alas!\\r\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not listen at all\\r\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley:\\r\\nshe was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta\\r\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten\\r\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;\\r\\nI always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short,\\r\\nyou know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\\r\\nIs he coming, Louisa?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOne morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,\\r\\nat which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into\\r\\nthe drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little\\r\\ninvalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,\\r\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,\\r\\nand could only say, \"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:\\r\\nMrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,\" before he walked\\r\\nto the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,\\r\\nI dare say,\" had been Anne\\'s reply, in all the confusion that was natural;\\r\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,\\r\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment, and released\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth as well as herself.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,\\r\\n\"I hope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there\\r\\nto satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,\\r\\nwhen, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person\\r\\ncrossing the little vestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head,\\r\\nto see the master of the house; but it proved to be one\\r\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter,\\r\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth\\r\\nthan Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe only attempted to say, \"How do you do?  Will you not sit down?\\r\\nThe others will be here presently.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently\\r\\nnot ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end\\r\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up\\r\\nthe newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnother minute brought another addition.  The younger boy,\\r\\na remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door\\r\\nopened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance\\r\\namong them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,\\r\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;\\r\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,\\r\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,\\r\\nbusy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.\\r\\nShe spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.\\r\\nOnce she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had\\r\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  You are extremely troublesome.\\r\\nI am very angry with you.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?\\r\\nDo not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to\\r\\ncousin Charles.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBut not a bit did Walter stir.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn another moment, however, she found herself in the state of\\r\\nbeing released from him; some one was taking him from her,\\r\\nthough he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands\\r\\nwere unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,\\r\\nbefore she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.\\r\\nShe could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,\\r\\nwith most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward\\r\\nto her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,\\r\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon\\r\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,\\r\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought\\r\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,\\r\\nproduced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,\\r\\nas she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary\\r\\nand the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,\\r\\nand leave the room.  She could not stay.  It might have been\\r\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--they\\r\\nwere now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.\\r\\nIt was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his having said,\\r\\nin a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth\\'s interference,\\r\\n\"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;\"\\r\\nand could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do\\r\\nwhat he ought to have done himself.  But neither Charles Hayter\\'s feelings,\\r\\nnor anybody\\'s feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better\\r\\narranged her own.  She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed\\r\\nof being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,\\r\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\r\\nto recover her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap10\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOther opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.\\r\\nAnne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\r\\nto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,\\r\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;\\r\\nfor while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite,\\r\\nshe could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\r\\nand experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.\\r\\nThey were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.\\r\\nIt was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,\\r\\nend in love with some.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted,\\r\\nand yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.\\r\\nAnne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,\\r\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.\\r\\nShe did not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction\\r\\nto her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware\\r\\nof the pain he was occasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph\\r\\nin his manner.  He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of\\r\\nany claims of Charles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting\\r\\nthe attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field.\\r\\nThree days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross;\\r\\na most decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;\\r\\nand having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books\\r\\nbefore him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,\\r\\nand talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.\\r\\nIt was Mary\\'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\r\\nfrom Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\r\\nof seeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter\\r\\nwas wise.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOne morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth\\r\\nbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage\\r\\nwere sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window\\r\\nby the sisters from the Mansion-house.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came\\r\\nthrough the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,\\r\\nthat they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded\\r\\nMary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied,\\r\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes,\\r\\nI should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\"\\r\\nAnne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely\\r\\nwhat they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity\\r\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being\\r\\nto be communicated, and everything being to be done together,\\r\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going,\\r\\nbut in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept\\r\\nthe Miss Musgroves\\' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,\\r\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening\\r\\nthe interference in any plan of their own.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,\"\\r\\nsaid Mary, as she went up stairs.  \"Everybody is always supposing\\r\\nthat I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,\\r\\nif we had refused to join them.  When people come in this manner\\r\\non purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nJust as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken out\\r\\na young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\\r\\nTheir time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\\r\\nfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne\\r\\nhave foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,\\r\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was\\r\\ntoo late to retract, and the whole six set forward together\\r\\nin the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently\\r\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne\\'s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where\\r\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,\\r\\nto keep with her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk\\r\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of\\r\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,\\r\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\r\\ndescriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and\\r\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,\\r\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,\\r\\nsome attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.\\r\\nShe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\r\\nand quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\\r\\nof Captain Wentworth\\'s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,\\r\\nshe should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\\r\\nIt was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,\\r\\nmight fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.\\r\\nLouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.\\r\\nThis distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech\\r\\nof Louisa\\'s which struck her.  After one of the many praises of the day,\\r\\nwhich were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added:--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to take\\r\\na long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from\\r\\nsome of these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.\\r\\nI wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen\\r\\nvery often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;\\r\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,\" cried Louisa, \"but if it were\\r\\nreally so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,\\r\\nas she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever\\r\\nseparate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely\\r\\nby anybody else.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was spoken with enthusiasm.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\"\\r\\nAnd there was silence between them for a little while.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet scenes\\r\\nof autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\\r\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\\r\\nhappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,\\r\\nblessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they struck by order\\r\\ninto another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?\"\\r\\nBut nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWinthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes\\r\\nto be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;\\r\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,\\r\\nwhere the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\r\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning\\r\\nto have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,\\r\\nwhich parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view\\r\\nof the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWinthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them;\\r\\nan indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\\r\\nbuildings of a farm-yard.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMary exclaimed, \"Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!\\r\\nWell now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHenrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles\\r\\nwalking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready\\r\\nto do as Mary wished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\"\\r\\ncried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be\\r\\narguing the matter warmly.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\r\\nof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\\r\\nthough more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.\\r\\nBut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;\\r\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\r\\nof an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,\\r\\n\"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\r\\nthan any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,\\r\\nher look and manner declared, that go she would not.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\\r\\nit was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he\\r\\nand Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt\\r\\nand cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\r\\nof the hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;\\r\\nand, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking\\r\\nto Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,\\r\\nand saying to Captain Wentworth--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you,\\r\\nI have never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\\r\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne\\r\\nperfectly knew the meaning of.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:\\r\\nLouisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself\\r\\non the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others\\r\\nall stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away,\\r\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,\\r\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,\\r\\nMary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,\\r\\nwas sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could\\r\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also.  She turned through\\r\\nthe same gate, but could not see them.  Anne found a nice seat\\r\\nfor her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which\\r\\nshe had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.\\r\\nMary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa\\r\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\\r\\ntill she overtook her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\\r\\nmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\\r\\ncentre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa\\'s voice was\\r\\nthe first distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some\\r\\neager speech.  What Anne first heard was--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened\\r\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from\\r\\ndoing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,\\r\\nby the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?\\r\\nNo, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have\\r\\nmade up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely\\r\\nto have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\\r\\ngiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints\\r\\nyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,\\r\\nthe last time I was in company with him,  I need not affect\\r\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than\\r\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;\\r\\nand woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,\\r\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\r\\nstrength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist\\r\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this.  Your sister is\\r\\nan amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,\\r\\nI see.  If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much\\r\\nof your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no doubt,\\r\\nyou have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too yielding\\r\\nand indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.\\r\\nYou are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody\\r\\nmay sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is a nut,\"\\r\\nsaid he, catching one down from an upper bough, \"to exemplify:\\r\\na beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,\\r\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not\\r\\na weak spot anywhere.  This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity,\\r\\n\"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,\\r\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\r\\nsupposed capable of.\"  Then returning to his former earnest tone--\"My\\r\\nfirst wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.\\r\\nIf Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,\\r\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa\\r\\ncould have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,\\r\\nspoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling.\\r\\nFor herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.\\r\\nWhile she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,\\r\\nand they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,\\r\\nhowever, Louisa spoke again.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;\\r\\n\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense\\r\\nand pride--the Elliot pride.  She has a great deal too much\\r\\nof the Elliot pride.  We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.\\r\\nI suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause, Captain Wentworth said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Do you mean that she refused him?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! yes; certainly.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"When did that happen?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;\\r\\nbut I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had\\r\\naccepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better;\\r\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s doing, that she did not.  They think Charles\\r\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell,\\r\\nand that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.\\r\\nHer own emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from,\\r\\nbefore she could move.  The listener\\'s proverbial fate was\\r\\nnot absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard\\r\\na great deal of very painful import.  She saw how her own character\\r\\nwas considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree\\r\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\r\\nextreme agitation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found,\\r\\nand walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,\\r\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\r\\ncollected, and once more in motion together.  Her spirits wanted\\r\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\\r\\nCharles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne\\r\\ncould not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem\\r\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing\\r\\non the gentleman\\'s side, and a relenting on the lady\\'s, and that they\\r\\nwere now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.\\r\\nHenrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles\\r\\nHayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other\\r\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nEverything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;\\r\\nnothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,\\r\\nor even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much\\r\\nas the other two.  In a long strip of meadow land, where there was\\r\\nample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;\\r\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation,\\r\\nand least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.  She joined Charles\\r\\nand Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles\\'s other arm;\\r\\nbut Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper\\r\\nwith his wife.  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,\\r\\nand was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was\\r\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\r\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began\\r\\nto complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,\\r\\nin being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,\\r\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\r\\na momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it\\r\\nwas to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\\r\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been\\r\\nsome time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft\\'s gig.\\r\\nHe and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\\r\\nUpon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,\\r\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;\\r\\nit would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.\\r\\nThe invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves\\r\\nwere not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked\\r\\nbefore any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride\\r\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\\r\\nopposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\\r\\nwhen Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\r\\nto his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft.\\r\\n\"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room\\r\\nfor three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might\\r\\nsit four.  You must, indeed, you must.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,\\r\\nshe was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral\\'s kind urgency\\r\\ncame in support of his wife\\'s; they would not be refused;\\r\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\r\\nto leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word,\\r\\nturned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nYes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had\\r\\nplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it,\\r\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution\\r\\nto give her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of\\r\\nhis disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.\\r\\nThis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.\\r\\nShe understood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not\\r\\nbe unfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it\\r\\nwith high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,\\r\\nand though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\\r\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder\\r\\nof former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged\\r\\nfriendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,\\r\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\r\\nof pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\r\\nwere at first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way\\r\\nalong the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.\\r\\nShe then found them talking of \"Frederick.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,\"\\r\\nsaid the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  He has been\\r\\nrunning after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\\r\\nAy, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have\\r\\nsettled it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make\\r\\nlong courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear,\\r\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\r\\nin our lodgings at North Yarmouth?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;\\r\\n\"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,\\r\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.\\r\\nI had known you by character, however, long before.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\\r\\nto wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.\\r\\nI wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\\r\\none of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always\\r\\nbe company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are;\\r\\nI hardly know one from the other.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft,\\r\\nin a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that\\r\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\r\\nof her brother; \"and a very respectable family.  One could not be\\r\\nconnected with better people.  My dear Admiral, that post!\\r\\nwe shall certainly take that post.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\r\\npassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\r\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;\\r\\nand Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,\\r\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\r\\nof their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap11\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe time now approached for Lady Russell\\'s return:  the day was even fixed;\\r\\nand Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,\\r\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning\\r\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth,\\r\\nwithin half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,\\r\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families.\\r\\nThis was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time\\r\\nat Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\r\\nas leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,\\r\\nshe believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,\\r\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,\\r\\nin leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed\\r\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;\\r\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.  They did not like each other,\\r\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell\\r\\nto see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,\\r\\nand she too little.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\r\\nher removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed\\r\\nquite long enough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always\\r\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months\\' visit there,\\r\\nbut he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way\\r\\nwhich she had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen\\r\\nand unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them\\r\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last,\\r\\nhad brought intelligence of Captain Harville\\'s being settled\\r\\nwith his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,\\r\\nquite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville\\r\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\r\\ntwo years before, and Captain Wentworth\\'s anxiety to see him\\r\\nhad determined him to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there\\r\\nfor four-and-twenty hours.  His acquittal was complete,\\r\\nhis friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,\\r\\nand his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to\\r\\nby the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves,\\r\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked\\r\\nof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross;\\r\\nthough November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,\\r\\nLouisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed\\r\\nthe resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,\\r\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,\\r\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\r\\ntill summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta,\\r\\nLouisa, and Captain Wentworth.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;\\r\\nbut to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;\\r\\nand when it came to be rationally considered, a day in\\r\\nthe middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\\r\\nafter deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,\\r\\nfor going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,\\r\\nand not to be expected back till the next day\\'s dinner.  This was felt\\r\\nto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House\\r\\nat rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\\r\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove\\'s coach\\r\\ncontaining the four ladies, and Charles\\'s curricle, in which\\r\\nhe drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme,\\r\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,\\r\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\r\\nfor looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,\\r\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\r\\ndown to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement\\r\\nor variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms\\r\\nwere shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family\\r\\nbut of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire\\r\\nin the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,\\r\\nthe principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb,\\r\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,\\r\\nis animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself,\\r\\nits old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful\\r\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what\\r\\nthe stranger\\'s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,\\r\\nwho does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme,\\r\\nto make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in its neighbourhood,\\r\\nCharmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,\\r\\nand still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,\\r\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot\\r\\nfor watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;\\r\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all,\\r\\nPinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where\\r\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,\\r\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\r\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,\\r\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may\\r\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed\\r\\nIsle of Wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again,\\r\\nto make the worth of Lyme understood.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted\\r\\nand melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves\\r\\non the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze\\r\\non a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\\r\\nproceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself\\r\\nand on Captain Wentworth\\'s account:  for in a small house,\\r\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,\\r\\nand he was to join them on the Cobb.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa\\r\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,\\r\\nwhen they saw him coming after them, with three companions,\\r\\nall well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville,\\r\\nand a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;\\r\\nand the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him,\\r\\non his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as\\r\\nan excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,\\r\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,\\r\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life,\\r\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.\\r\\nHe had been engaged to Captain Harville\\'s sister, and was now\\r\\nmourning her loss.  They had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\r\\nand promotion.  Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;\\r\\npromotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.\\r\\nShe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth\\r\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\r\\nthan poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply\\r\\nafflicted under the dreadful change.  He considered his disposition\\r\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings\\r\\nwith quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,\\r\\nand sedentary pursuits.  To finish the interest of the story,\\r\\nthe friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible,\\r\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,\\r\\nand Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.  Captain Harville\\r\\nhad taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,\\r\\nand his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,\\r\\nand by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement\\r\\nof Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick\\'s\\r\\nstate of mind.  The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick\\r\\nwas very great.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward\\r\\nto meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart\\r\\nthan I have.  I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.\\r\\nHe is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;\\r\\nyounger as a man.  He will rally again, and be happy with another.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall,\\r\\ndark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;\\r\\nand from strong features and want of health, looking much older\\r\\nthan Captain Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was,\\r\\nthe youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,\\r\\na little man.  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,\\r\\njust as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,\\r\\nwas a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.\\r\\nMrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,\\r\\nto have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant\\r\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own,\\r\\nbecause the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable\\r\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.\\r\\nThe dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,\\r\\naccepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth\\r\\nshould have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it\\r\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this,\\r\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,\\r\\nso unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners\\r\\nof formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\r\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.\\r\\n\"These would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;\\r\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOn quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\\r\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\r\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had\\r\\na moment\\'s astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost\\r\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\r\\nthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville,\\r\\nto turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies\\r\\nof lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors\\r\\nagainst the winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in\\r\\nthe fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries\\r\\nprovided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,\\r\\nwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,\\r\\nexcellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable\\r\\nfrom all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited,\\r\\nwere more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession,\\r\\nthe fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,\\r\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,\\r\\nmade it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived\\r\\nexcellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,\\r\\nfor a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of\\r\\nCaptain Benwick.  His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;\\r\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\r\\nconstant employment within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,\\r\\nhe glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles\\r\\nand pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,\\r\\nsat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\r\\nquitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking,\\r\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\r\\nof the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,\\r\\ntheir uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\r\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in England;\\r\\nthat they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be\\r\\nrespected and loved.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme\\r\\nanswered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being\\r\\n\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\"\\r\\nand the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies\\r\\nfrom the heads of the inn.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\r\\nto being in Captain Wentworth\\'s company than she had at first imagined\\r\\ncould ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,\\r\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\r\\n(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,\\r\\nbut Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening;\\r\\nand he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than\\r\\nhad been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick\\r\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\r\\nso many strangers.  He ventured among them again, however,\\r\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\r\\nof the party in general.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhile Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room,\\r\\nand by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance\\r\\nto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne\\'s lot to be placed\\r\\nrather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse\\r\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.\\r\\nHe was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of\\r\\nher countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;\\r\\nand Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.\\r\\nHe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,\\r\\nthough principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having\\r\\ngiven him at least an evening\\'s indulgence in the discussion of subjects,\\r\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope\\r\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\r\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out\\r\\nof their conversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved;\\r\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\r\\nusual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of\\r\\nthe present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\r\\nas to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion\\r\\nor The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour\\r\\nand The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced,\\r\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\r\\nof the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\r\\nof the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines\\r\\nwhich imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,\\r\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,\\r\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,\\r\\nand to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\r\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;\\r\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\r\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHis looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion\\r\\nto his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself\\r\\nthe right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend\\r\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested\\r\\nto particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,\\r\\nsuch collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters\\r\\nof worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment\\r\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,\\r\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for\\r\\nthe interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,\\r\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\r\\non grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,\\r\\nand promised to procure and read them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhen the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea\\r\\nof her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\r\\nwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,\\r\\non more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists\\r\\nand preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\r\\nwould ill bear examination.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap12\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party\\r\\nthe next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.\\r\\nThey went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,\\r\\nwhich a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\r\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning;\\r\\ngloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling\\r\\nbreeze--and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,\\r\\nthe sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been\\r\\nof the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness,\\r\\nlast spring twelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme\\r\\nfor a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;\\r\\nand, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.\\r\\nNow, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\r\\nentirely by the sea.  I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely,\\r\\nand fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?  Do not you agree with me,\\r\\nthat it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?\\r\\nShe has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would\\r\\nmake it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad\\r\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,\\r\\nin case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it quite melancholy\\r\\nto have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been\\r\\ndoing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place\\r\\nlike Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out\\r\\nfrom all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.\\r\\nI really think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation,\\r\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.\\r\\nMy only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\\r\\nHe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous\\r\\nI must say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?\\r\\nDo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,\\r\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,\\r\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person?  And at Lyme too,\\r\\nonly seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,\\r\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,\\r\\nand entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into\\r\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good\\r\\nof a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?\\r\\nShe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;\\r\\nfelt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very\\r\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man,\\r\\nas a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at\\r\\nthe advantage of such resident curate\\'s being married.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,\\r\\n\"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate\\r\\nwith Dr Shirley.  I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of\\r\\nthe greatest influence with everybody!  I always look upon her as able\\r\\nto persuade a person to anything!  I am afraid of her, as I have\\r\\ntold you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;\\r\\nbut I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour\\r\\nat Uppercross.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was amused by Henrietta\\'s manner of being grateful,\\r\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\r\\nof Henrietta\\'s views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\r\\nwith any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however,\\r\\nfor a general answer, and a wish that such another woman\\r\\nwere at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,\\r\\non seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them.\\r\\nThey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;\\r\\nbut Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something\\r\\nto procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.\\r\\nThey were all at her disposal.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhen they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,\\r\\nat the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,\\r\\nand stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him;\\r\\nand as they passed, Anne\\'s face caught his eye, and he looked at her\\r\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.\\r\\nShe was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,\\r\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\r\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye\\r\\nwhich it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,\\r\\n(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\r\\nshewed his noticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance,\\r\\na glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you,\\r\\nand even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about\\r\\na little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards\\r\\nquickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against\\r\\nthe very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.\\r\\nShe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,\\r\\nand determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about\\r\\nnear the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.\\r\\nBoth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.\\r\\nIt was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;\\r\\nand this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again\\r\\nby the gentleman\\'s looks, that he thought hers very lovely,\\r\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was\\r\\na man of exceedingly good manners.  He seemed about thirty,\\r\\nand though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  Anne felt that\\r\\nshe should like to know who he was.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,\\r\\n(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party\\r\\nto the window.  It was a gentleman\\'s carriage, a curricle,\\r\\nbut only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;\\r\\nsomebody must be going away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might\\r\\ncompare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne\\'s curiosity,\\r\\nand the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner\\r\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\r\\nand civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne,\\r\\n\"it is the very man we passed.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him\\r\\nas far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\\r\\nThe waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Pray,\" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\\r\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night\\r\\nfrom Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were\\r\\nat dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath\\r\\nand London.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Elliot!\"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,\\r\\nbefore all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\\r\\nof a waiter.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Bless me!\" cried Mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot,\\r\\nit must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you see,\\r\\njust as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!\\r\\nIn the very same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?\\r\\nmy father\\'s next heir?  Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,\\r\\n\"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged\\r\\nto the Kellynch family?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said\\r\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"There! you see!\" cried Mary in an ecstasy, \"just as I said!\\r\\nHeir to Sir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out,\\r\\nif it was so.  Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants\\r\\ntake care to publish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive\\r\\nhow extraordinary!  I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had\\r\\nbeen aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.\\r\\nWhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!\\r\\nDo you think he had the Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him,\\r\\nI was looking at the horses; but I think he had something\\r\\nof the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!\\r\\nOh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,\\r\\nso it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,\\r\\nand the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,\\r\\none should have known him by the livery.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\"\\r\\nsaid Captain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement\\r\\nof Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhen she could command Mary\\'s attention, Anne quietly tried\\r\\nto convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years,\\r\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\r\\nat all desirable.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAt the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself\\r\\nto have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch\\r\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.\\r\\nShe would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him\\r\\nthe second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having\\r\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt\\r\\nquite ill-used by Anne\\'s having actually run against him in the passage,\\r\\nand received his very polite excuses, while she had never been\\r\\nnear him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain\\r\\na perfect secret.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot,\\r\\nthe next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly\\r\\nought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance\\r\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,\\r\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given\\r\\nher father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth\\'s particular share in it\\r\\nshe suspected; and that Mr Elliot\\'s idea always produced irritation in both\\r\\nwas beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil\\r\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth\\r\\nfell on Anne.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBreakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain\\r\\nand Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed\\r\\nto take their last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off\\r\\nfor Uppercross by one, and in the meanwhile were to be all together,\\r\\nand out of doors as long as they could.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\\r\\nfairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening\\r\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together\\r\\nsome time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,\\r\\nand still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,\\r\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something\\r\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of\\r\\nCaptain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Miss Elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\\r\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have\\r\\nsuch company oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;\\r\\nbut what can we do?  We cannot part.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible;\\r\\nbut in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,\\r\\nand you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend\\r\\nmay yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only June.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,\\r\\njust made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him;\\r\\nhe sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.\\r\\nThere the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I.\\r\\nI would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could do it,\\r\\nbut that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The Laconia\\r\\nhad come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her\\r\\nbeing sent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest;\\r\\nwrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,\\r\\ntravelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off\\r\\nto the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.\\r\\nThat\\'s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.\\r\\nYou may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\\r\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed\\r\\nable to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,\\r\\nand when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Harville\\'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\r\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction\\r\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would\\r\\naccompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.\\r\\nBy all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew\\r\\nnear the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,\\r\\nall were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,\\r\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\\r\\nwould be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,\\r\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\r\\nmay be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville\\r\\nat their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick,\\r\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make\\r\\nthe proper adieus to the Cobb.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron\\'s\\r\\n\"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by\\r\\ntheir present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\r\\nattention was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\\r\\nfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,\\r\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\\r\\nexcepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.\\r\\nIn all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;\\r\\nthe sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement\\r\\nfor her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;\\r\\nhe did it, however.  She was safely down, and instantly,\\r\\nto show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.\\r\\nHe advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,\\r\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"I am determined\\r\\nI will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,\\r\\nshe fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!\\r\\nThere was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,\\r\\nshe breathed not, her face was like death.  The horror of the moment\\r\\nto all who stood around!\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\\r\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.\\r\\n\"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of her\\r\\nhusband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;\\r\\nand in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost\\r\\nher senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain\\r\\nBenwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which\\r\\nburst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if\\r\\nall his own strength were gone.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven\\'s sake go to him.\\r\\nI can support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands,\\r\\nrub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,\\r\\ndisengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;\\r\\nand Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,\\r\\nand everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;\\r\\nwhile Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,\\r\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh God! her father and mother!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"A surgeon!\" said Anne.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying\\r\\nonly--\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,\\r\\nwhen Anne eagerly suggested--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?\\r\\nHe knows where a surgeon is to be found.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nEvery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,\\r\\nand in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had\\r\\nresigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother\\'s care,\\r\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said\\r\\nwhich of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate\\r\\nbrother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes\\r\\nfrom one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,\\r\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him\\r\\nfor help which he could not give.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,\\r\\nwhich instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,\\r\\nto suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,\\r\\nto assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her\\r\\nfor directions.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?\\r\\nWhat, in heaven\\'s name, is to be done next?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s eyes were also turned towards her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure:\\r\\ncarry her gently to the inn.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively\\r\\ncollected, and eager to be doing something.  \"I will carry her myself.\\r\\nMusgrove, take care of the others.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBy this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\r\\nand boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,\\r\\nto be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of\\r\\na dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine\\r\\nas the first report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people\\r\\nHenrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,\\r\\nshe was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,\\r\\nand Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back\\r\\nwith feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,\\r\\nand so light of heart, they had passed along.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.\\r\\nCaptain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance\\r\\nwhich showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\\r\\ninformed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.\\r\\nShocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves\\r\\nthat could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife\\r\\ndecided what was to be done.  She must be taken to their house;\\r\\nall must go to their house; and await the surgeon\\'s arrival there.\\r\\nThey would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all\\r\\nbeneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville\\'s direction,\\r\\nwas conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,\\r\\nassistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband\\r\\nto all who needed them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLouisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,\\r\\nwithout apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life,\\r\\nhowever, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly\\r\\nincapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept,\\r\\nby the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.\\r\\nMary, too, was growing calmer.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.\\r\\nThey were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.\\r\\nThe head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\\r\\nrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThat he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say\\r\\na few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;\\r\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,\\r\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,\\r\\nmay be conceived.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered\\r\\nby Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;\\r\\nnor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it\\r\\nwith folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by\\r\\nthe various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection\\r\\nto calm them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLouisa\\'s limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,\\r\\nas to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to each other\\r\\nand consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing\\r\\nto her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble,\\r\\ndid not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The Harvilles\\r\\nsilenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.\\r\\nThey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\r\\nbegan to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,\\r\\nand get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.\\r\\nThey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;\\r\\nand yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid\\'s room,\\r\\nor swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not\\r\\nfinding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;\\r\\nthough, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be\\r\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville\\'s care entirely.\\r\\nMrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,\\r\\nwho had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,\\r\\nwas just such another.  Between these two, she could want\\r\\nno possible attendance by day or night.  And all this was said\\r\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,\\r\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.\\r\\n\"Uppercross, the necessity of some one\\'s going to Uppercross;\\r\\nthe news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove;\\r\\nthe lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they\\r\\nought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\"\\r\\nAt first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\r\\nthan such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,\\r\\nexerting himself, said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.\\r\\nEvery minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off\\r\\nfor Uppercross instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.\\r\\nHe would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;\\r\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.\\r\\nSo far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.\\r\\nShe, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The usefulness\\r\\nof her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in Louisa\\'s room,\\r\\nor to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!\\r\\nShe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,\\r\\nyet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought\\r\\nof her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,\\r\\nshe was anxious to be at home.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly\\r\\ndown from Louisa\\'s room, could not but hear what followed,\\r\\nfor the parlour door was open.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth,\\r\\n\"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.\\r\\nBut as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville,\\r\\nI think it need be only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,\\r\\nwish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper,\\r\\nso capable as Anne.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\r\\nso spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said,\\r\\nand she then appeared.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\\r\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,\\r\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply,\\r\\nand he recollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself\\r\\nmost willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been\\r\\nthinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor\\r\\nin Louisa\\'s room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville\\r\\nwould but think so.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOne thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather desirable\\r\\nthat Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\r\\nshare of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses\\r\\nto take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;\\r\\nand Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed,\\r\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,\\r\\nand leave Mr Musgrove\\'s carriage and horses to be sent home\\r\\nthe next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage\\r\\nof sending an account of Louisa\\'s night.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\\r\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was\\r\\nmade known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.\\r\\nShe was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice\\r\\nin being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was\\r\\nnothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right\\r\\nto stay in Henrietta\\'s stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?\\r\\nAnd to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!\\r\\nNo, it was too unkind.  And in short, she said more than her husband\\r\\ncould long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose\\r\\nwhen he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne\\r\\nwas inevitable.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\r\\nand ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off\\r\\nfor the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick\\r\\nattending to her.  She gave a moment\\'s recollection, as they hurried along,\\r\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\r\\nearlier in the morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta\\'s schemes\\r\\nfor Dr Shirley\\'s leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had\\r\\nfirst seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given\\r\\nto any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,\\r\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt\\r\\nan increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even\\r\\nin thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing\\r\\ntheir acquaintance.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,\\r\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;\\r\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\r\\nfor the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,\\r\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to,\\r\\nmade but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her\\r\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating\\r\\nthe feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have\\r\\nattended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,\\r\\nfor his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\r\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn the meanwhile she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,\\r\\nand placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\\r\\ncircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme.\\r\\nHow the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;\\r\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.\\r\\nIt was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to Henrietta;\\r\\nalways turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view\\r\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In general,\\r\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta\\r\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only,\\r\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated\\r\\nwalk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,\\r\\nhe burst forth, as if wholly overcome--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Don\\'t talk of it, don\\'t talk of it,\" he cried.  \"Oh God! that I had\\r\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!\\r\\nBut so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness\\r\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\r\\nof firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,\\r\\nlike all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions\\r\\nand limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\r\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\r\\nas a very resolute character.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\r\\nand the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by\\r\\nsome dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long\\r\\nas on the day before.  It was growing quite dusk, however,\\r\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been\\r\\ntotal silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back\\r\\nin the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her\\r\\nhaving cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,\\r\\nAnne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.\\r\\nIn a low, cautious voice, he said:--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not\\r\\nappear at first.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether\\r\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in\\r\\nand break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance\\r\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,\\r\\nand of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became\\r\\na sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhen the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,\\r\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,\\r\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced\\r\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;\\r\\nand when the horses were baited, he was off.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\n(End of volume one.)\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap13\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe remainder of Anne\\'s time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,\\r\\nwas spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction\\r\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,\\r\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,\\r\\nin Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s distressed state of spirits, would have\\r\\nbeen difficulties.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was\\r\\nmuch the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.\\r\\nCharles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and\\r\\nmore particular account.  He was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure\\r\\nmust not be hoped, but everything was going on as well\\r\\nas the nature of the case admitted.  In speaking of the Harvilles,\\r\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,\\r\\nespecially of Mrs Harville\\'s exertions as a nurse.  \"She really left\\r\\nnothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been persuaded to go early\\r\\nto their inn last night.  Mary had been hysterical again this morning.\\r\\nWhen he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick,\\r\\nwhich, he hoped, would do her good.  He almost wished she had been\\r\\nprevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,\\r\\nthat Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father\\r\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.\\r\\nIt would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,\\r\\nand increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed\\r\\nand was acted upon.  A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne,\\r\\nand Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid\\r\\nof the family, one who having brought up all the children,\\r\\nand seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,\\r\\nsent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery\\r\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\r\\nget near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being\\r\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of\\r\\ngetting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;\\r\\nbut without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,\\r\\nand found practicable so soon.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all\\r\\nthe minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain\\r\\nevery twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme,\\r\\nand his account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense\\r\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed\\r\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s appearing fixed in Lyme.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\\r\\n\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters\\r\\nfor one another.\"  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought\\r\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\r\\nto which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.\\r\\nShe had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;\\r\\ngo to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,\\r\\nas it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.\\r\\nThey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;\\r\\nthey might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children;\\r\\nand in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted\\r\\nwith what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her\\r\\nlast morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,\\r\\nand sending them off at an early hour, though her being left\\r\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,\\r\\nshe was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled\\r\\nand animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross\\r\\nits cheerful character.  A few days had made a change indeed!\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIf Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than\\r\\nformer happiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt,\\r\\nto her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.\\r\\nA few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by\\r\\nher silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy\\r\\nand gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,\\r\\nall that was most unlike Anne Elliot!\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAn hour\\'s complete leisure for such reflections as these,\\r\\non a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out\\r\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough\\r\\nto make the sound of Lady Russell\\'s carriage exceedingly welcome;\\r\\nand yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House,\\r\\nor look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and\\r\\ncomfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses\\r\\nthe last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.\\r\\nScenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.\\r\\nIt stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,\\r\\nbut now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,\\r\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\\r\\nnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.\\r\\nShe left it all behind her, all but the recollection that\\r\\nsuch things had been.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell\\'s house\\r\\nin September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of\\r\\nits being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade\\r\\nand escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\r\\nand elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes\\r\\nof its mistress.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell\\'s joy in meeting her.\\r\\nShe knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily,\\r\\neither Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell\\r\\nfancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,\\r\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\r\\nof her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\r\\na second spring of youth and beauty.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhen they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.\\r\\nThe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch,\\r\\nand which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother\\r\\namong the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\\r\\nShe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.\\r\\nTheir concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;\\r\\nand when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,\\r\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place,\\r\\nwhich had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still\\r\\nbe with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\r\\nhow much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove,\\r\\nand all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her\\r\\nwas the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,\\r\\nthan her own father\\'s house in Camden Place, or her own sister\\'s intimacy\\r\\nwith Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert herself\\r\\nto meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,\\r\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\r\\non another subject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.\\r\\nLady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,\\r\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must\\r\\nbe talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,\\r\\nlament the result, and Captain Wentworth\\'s name must be mentioned by both.\\r\\nAnne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.\\r\\nShe could not speak the name, and look straight forward to\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\r\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.\\r\\nWhen this was told, his name distressed her no longer.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,\\r\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\\r\\nthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat\\r\\nof the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards,\\r\\nbe charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\\r\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,\\r\\nwhich found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought\\r\\na rather improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period,\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter\\r\\nself-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,\\r\\n\"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon.\\r\\nAnne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?\\r\\nIt will be some trial to us both.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,\\r\\nin observing--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;\\r\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.\\r\\nBy remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact\\r\\nso high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father\\r\\nso very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure\\r\\nof a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,\\r\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,\\r\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\r\\nwho deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed\\r\\ninto better hands than its owners\\'.  These convictions must unquestionably\\r\\nhave their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded\\r\\nthat pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again,\\r\\nand returning through the well-known apartments.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself,\\r\\n\"These rooms ought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen\\r\\nin their destination!  How unworthily occupied!  An ancient family\\r\\nto be so driven away!  Strangers filling their place!\"\\r\\nNo, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where\\r\\nshe had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description\\r\\nto heave.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\r\\nof fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,\\r\\nreceiving her in that house, there was particular attention.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,\\r\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared\\r\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;\\r\\nthat Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time\\r\\nsince the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had\\r\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours\\r\\nand then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention\\r\\nof quitting it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found,\\r\\nparticularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot\\'s not being\\r\\nthe worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.\\r\\nThis was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\r\\ncould have done.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style\\r\\nby a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work\\r\\non ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\r\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;\\r\\nthat its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,\\r\\nhow long Miss Musgrove\\'s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable\\r\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!\\r\\nThe Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this,\\r\\nfor a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress\\'s head,\\r\\nis not it, Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,\\r\\ntruly!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAdmiral Croft\\'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,\\r\\nbut they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity\\r\\nof character were irresistible.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from\\r\\na little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  I had not\\r\\nrecollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.\\r\\nBut now, do not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms\\r\\nin the house if you like it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery\\r\\nat any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\r\\nby that door.  A good place is not it?  But,\" (checking himself),\\r\\n\"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept\\r\\nin the butler\\'s room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.\\r\\nOne man\\'s ways may be as good as another\\'s, but we all like our own best.\\r\\nAnd so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you\\r\\nto go about the house or not.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"We have made very few changes either,\" continued the Admiral,\\r\\nafter thinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door,\\r\\nat Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.\\r\\nThe wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\r\\nof its opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter\\r\\nwhat we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\r\\nthe house ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say,\\r\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\r\\nfor the better.  My wife should have the credit of them, however.\\r\\nI have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\r\\nlooking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father\\'s.\\r\\nA very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure:\\r\\nbut I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection),\\r\\n\"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.\\r\\nSuch a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away\\r\\nfrom one\\'s self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon\\r\\nshifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my\\r\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing\\r\\nthat I never go near.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\\r\\nand the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,\\r\\ntook up the subject again, to say--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,\\r\\npray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft\\'s, and say that we are\\r\\nsettled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find\\r\\nwith the place.  The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,\\r\\nI grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,\\r\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter.  And take it altogether,\\r\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,\\r\\nthere is not one that we like better than this.  Pray say so,\\r\\nwith my compliments.  He will be glad to hear it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other:\\r\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\r\\nfar at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced\\r\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions\\r\\nin the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again\\r\\nbefore Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSo ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall,\\r\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe enough,\\r\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\r\\non the subject.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap14\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThough Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after\\r\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s going than Anne conceived they could have been\\r\\nat all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;\\r\\nand as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross\\r\\nthey drove over to the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up;\\r\\nbut her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves\\r\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though\\r\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,\\r\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\r\\nthe removal home; and her father and mother, who must return\\r\\nin time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays,\\r\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had\\r\\ngot Mrs Harville\\'s children away as much as she could, every possible\\r\\nsupply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience\\r\\nto the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them\\r\\nto come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been\\r\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\r\\nand hospitable.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident\\r\\nby her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.\\r\\nCharles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when\\r\\nthey dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,\\r\\nand at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence;\\r\\nbut then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\r\\non finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much\\r\\ngoing on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\r\\nand the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,\\r\\nand changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been\\r\\nmuch in favour of Lyme.  She had been taken to Charmouth too,\\r\\nand she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many\\r\\nmore people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;\\r\\nand all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,\\r\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne enquired after Captain Benwick. Mary\\'s face was clouded directly.\\r\\nCharles laughed.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is\\r\\na very odd young man.  I do not know what he would be at.\\r\\nWe asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook\\r\\nto give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,\\r\\nI thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,\\r\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse; \\'he never shot\\' and he had\\r\\n\\'been quite misunderstood,\\' and he had promised this and he had\\r\\npromised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come.\\r\\nI suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word\\r\\nI should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage\\r\\nfor such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles laughed again and said, \"Now Mary, you know very well\\r\\nhow it really was.  It was all your doing,\" (turning to Anne.)\\r\\n\"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:\\r\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered\\r\\nthat Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,\\r\\nand he had not courage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour.\\r\\nMary knows it is.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBut Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from\\r\\nnot considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation\\r\\nto be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe\\r\\nAnne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be\\r\\nleft to be guessed.  Anne\\'s good-will, however, was not to be lessened\\r\\nby what she heard.  She boldly acknowledged herself flattered,\\r\\nand continued her enquiries.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! he talks of you,\" cried Charles, \"in such terms--\"\\r\\nMary interrupted him. \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him\\r\\nmention Anne twice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne,\\r\\nhe never talks of you at all.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No,\" admitted Charles, \"I do not know that he ever does, in a general\\r\\nway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.\\r\\nHis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,\\r\\nand he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other\\r\\nin one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,\\r\\nbut it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta\\r\\nall about it; and then \\'Miss Elliot\\' was spoken of in the highest terms!\\r\\nNow Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were\\r\\nin the other room.  \\'Elegance, sweetness, beauty.\\' Oh! there was no end\\r\\nof Miss Elliot\\'s charms.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit,\\r\\nif he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart\\r\\nis very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure\\r\\nyou will agree with me.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell, smiling.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma\\'am,\"\\r\\nsaid Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,\\r\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,\\r\\nhe will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself,\\r\\nyou may depend on it.  I told him the distance and the road,\\r\\nand I told him of the church\\'s being so very well worth seeing;\\r\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would\\r\\nbe a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;\\r\\nand I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.\\r\\nSo, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Any acquaintance of Anne\\'s will always be welcome to me,\"\\r\\nwas Lady Russell\\'s kind answer.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! as to being Anne\\'s acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather\\r\\nmy acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy\\r\\nto see Captain Benwick.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma\\'am.\\r\\nHe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with me,\\r\\nsometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.\\r\\nHe is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not like him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne.  \"I think Lady Russell would like him.\\r\\nI think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would\\r\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.\\r\\nHe is just Lady Russell\\'s sort.  Give him a book, and he will\\r\\nread all day long.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  \"He will sit poring\\r\\nover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\\r\\ndrops one\\'s scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think\\r\\nLady Russell would like that?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell could not help laughing.  \"Upon my word,\" said she,\\r\\n\"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\r\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact\\r\\nas I may call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person\\r\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.\\r\\nI wish he may be induced to call here.  And when he does, Mary,\\r\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined\\r\\nnot to judge him beforehand.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with animation\\r\\nof their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see.\\r\\nHis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,\\r\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis decision checked Mary\\'s eagerness, and stopped her short\\r\\nin the midst of the Elliot countenance.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWith regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,\\r\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been\\r\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved,\\r\\nhe had improved, and he was now quite a different creature\\r\\nfrom what he had been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa;\\r\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\r\\nfrom an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,\\r\\non the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\r\\nor ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had talked of going\\r\\ndown to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick\\r\\nto go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick\\r\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both\\r\\noccasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.\\r\\nLady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might\\r\\nbe his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\r\\nin her father\\'s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,\\r\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.\\r\\nCaptain Benwick came not, however.  He was either less disposed for it\\r\\nthan Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him\\r\\na week\\'s indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy\\r\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,\\r\\nbringing with them Mrs Harville\\'s little children, to improve the noise\\r\\nof Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained with Louisa;\\r\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,\\r\\nwhen Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.\\r\\nThough neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter,\\r\\nnor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast\\r\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nImmediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,\\r\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\r\\nfrom the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side\\r\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk\\r\\nand gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,\\r\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys\\r\\nwere holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire,\\r\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise\\r\\nof the others.  Charles and Mary also came in, of course,\\r\\nduring their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\r\\nto Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,\\r\\ntalking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children\\r\\non his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed\\r\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,\\r\\nwhich Louisa\\'s illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove,\\r\\nwho got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,\\r\\nagain and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded\\r\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,\\r\\nwith a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,\\r\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\r\\nat home.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLouisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her\\r\\nbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\\r\\nwent to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her\\r\\nand stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,\\r\\nfor the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as\\r\\nthey were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross\\r\\nin the Christmas holidays.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nEverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;\\r\\nand sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort\\r\\nrather than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards,\\r\\nwas entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through\\r\\nthe long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place,\\r\\namidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,\\r\\nthe bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless\\r\\nclink of pattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises\\r\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose\\r\\nunder their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling,\\r\\nthough not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be\\r\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,\\r\\nthough very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view\\r\\nof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish\\r\\nof seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,\\r\\nhowever disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her\\r\\nwhen she arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles\\r\\nof Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.\\r\\nMr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had called\\r\\na second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If Elizabeth\\r\\nand her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains\\r\\nto seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,\\r\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was very wonderful\\r\\nif it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable\\r\\ncuriosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment\\r\\nshe had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man whom she had\\r\\nno wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he really sought\\r\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven\\r\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,\\r\\nbut she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,\\r\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove\\r\\nto her own lodgings, in Rivers Street.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap15\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place,\\r\\na lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;\\r\\nand both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment\\r\\nof many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I\\r\\nleave you again?\"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however,\\r\\nin the welcome she received, did her good.  Her father and sister\\r\\nwere glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,\\r\\nand met her with kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they\\r\\nsat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles\\r\\nwere more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she would\\r\\npretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others\\r\\nwas unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,\\r\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination\\r\\nto listen to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being\\r\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay,\\r\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be\\r\\nall their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little:\\r\\nit was all Bath.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\\r\\ntheir expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly\\r\\nthe best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\\r\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of,\\r\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,\\r\\nor the taste of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was\\r\\nexceedingly sought after.  Everybody was wanting to visit them.\\r\\nThey had drawn back from many introductions, and still were\\r\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHere were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father\\r\\nand sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh\\r\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see\\r\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,\\r\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;\\r\\nand she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open\\r\\nthe folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room\\r\\nto the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,\\r\\nwho had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of\\r\\nbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBut this was not all which they had to make them happy.\\r\\nThey had Mr Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.\\r\\nHe was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.\\r\\nHe had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath\\r\\nin November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of\\r\\nSir Walter\\'s being settled there had of course reached him,\\r\\nthough only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able\\r\\nto avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath,\\r\\nand his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card\\r\\nin Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,\\r\\nand when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\\r\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received\\r\\nas a relation again, that their former good understanding\\r\\nwas completely re-established.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away\\r\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated\\r\\nin misapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of\\r\\nthrowing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,\\r\\nbut knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint\\r\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\r\\nand the family honours, he was quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted\\r\\nof being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,\\r\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.\\r\\nHe was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct\\r\\nmust refute it.  He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him;\\r\\nand certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity\\r\\nof reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation\\r\\nand heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of\\r\\nmuch extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself;\\r\\nbut a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly\\r\\nrespectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,\\r\\nSir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough\\r\\nBuildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted\\r\\nto their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things\\r\\nrelative to the marriage, which made a material difference\\r\\nin the discredit of it.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nColonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted\\r\\nalso with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.\\r\\nShe was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,\\r\\naccomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.\\r\\nThere had been the charm.  She had sought him.  Without that attraction,\\r\\nnot all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was,\\r\\nmoreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.\\r\\nHere was a great deal to soften the business.  A very fine woman\\r\\nwith a large fortune, in love with him!  Sir Walter seemed to admit it\\r\\nas complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\r\\nin quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,\\r\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they\\r\\ngave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof\\r\\nof cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being\\r\\non intimate terms in Camden Place.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances,\\r\\nlarge allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\\r\\nShe heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant\\r\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\r\\nbut in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had\\r\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,\\r\\nin Mr Elliot\\'s wishing, after an interval of so many years,\\r\\nto be well received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain\\r\\nby being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.\\r\\nIn all probability he was already the richer of the two,\\r\\nand the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.\\r\\nA sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,\\r\\nwhy should it be an object to him?  She could only offer one solution;\\r\\nit was, perhaps, for Elizabeth\\'s sake.  There might really have been\\r\\na liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him\\r\\na different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,\\r\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly\\r\\nvery handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character\\r\\nmight never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,\\r\\nand when very young himself.  How her temper and understanding\\r\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\r\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish\\r\\nthat he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth\\r\\nwere his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,\\r\\nand that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent\\r\\nby a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot\\'s frequent visits\\r\\nwere talked of.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without\\r\\nbeing much attended to.  \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.\\r\\nThey did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.\"  They could not listen\\r\\nto her description of him.  They were describing him themselves;\\r\\nSir Walter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\r\\nappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,\\r\\nhis sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being\\r\\nvery much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;\\r\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\r\\nalmost every feature for the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think\\r\\nthat he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when\\r\\nthey last parted;\" but Sir Walter had \"not been able to return\\r\\nthe compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  He did not mean\\r\\nto complain, however.  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men,\\r\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of\\r\\nthe whole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be\\r\\nintroduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\"\\r\\nand there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,\\r\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot\\r\\nspoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known\\r\\nin Camden Place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.\\r\\nSir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be\\r\\nan excessively pretty woman, beautiful.  \"He longed to see her.\\r\\nHe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\r\\nhe was continually passing in the streets.  The worst of Bath was\\r\\nthe number of its plain women.  He did not mean to say that there were\\r\\nno pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.\\r\\nHe had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face\\r\\nwould be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,\\r\\nas he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted\\r\\neighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being\\r\\na tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty morning,\\r\\nto be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand\\r\\ncould stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were\\r\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!\\r\\nthey were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\r\\nIt was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\r\\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.\\r\\nHe had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis\\r\\n(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing\\r\\nthat every woman\\'s eye was upon him; every woman\\'s eye was sure to be\\r\\nupon Colonel Wallis.\"  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed\\r\\nto escape, however.  His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting\\r\\nthat Colonel Wallis\\'s companion might have as good a figure\\r\\nas Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.\\r\\n\"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not\\r\\nhappen every day.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has been\\r\\nin very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,\\r\\nand grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\\r\\nor a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door\\r\\nsuspended everything.  \"A knock at the door! and so late!\\r\\nIt was ten o\\'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine\\r\\nin Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home\\r\\nto ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.\\r\\nMrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot\\'s knock.\"  Mrs Clay was right.\\r\\nWith all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,\\r\\nMr Elliot was ushered into the room.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\\r\\nAnne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,\\r\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,\\r\\nbut \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\r\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &amp;c. &amp;c; which was\\r\\nall as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part\\r\\nmust follow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter;\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\"\\r\\n(there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and\\r\\nblushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features\\r\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement\\r\\nat his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware\\r\\nof who she was.  He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished\\r\\nthan pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity\\r\\nhe welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated\\r\\nto be received as an acquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking\\r\\nas he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,\\r\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,\\r\\nso easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them\\r\\nin excellence to only one person\\'s manners.  They were not the same,\\r\\nbut they were, perhaps, equally good.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\\r\\nThere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes\\r\\nwere enough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions,\\r\\nhis choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all\\r\\nthe operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could,\\r\\nhe began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions\\r\\nrespecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\r\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;\\r\\nto give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that\\r\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.\\r\\nShe gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.\\r\\nHis regret increased as he listened.  He had spent his whole\\r\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,\\r\\nmirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,\\r\\nlonged to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\r\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.\\r\\nIf he had but asked who the party were!  The name of Musgrove would\\r\\nhave told him enough.  \"Well, it would serve to cure him of\\r\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,\\r\\nwhich he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal\\r\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,\\r\\n\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,\\r\\nare more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings\\r\\nin the world.  The folly of the means they often employ\\r\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBut he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone:\\r\\nhe knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,\\r\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHis enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene\\r\\nshe had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.\\r\\nHaving alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.\\r\\nWhen he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,\\r\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.\\r\\nShe could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish\\r\\nof really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern\\r\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece\\r\\nhad struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman\\r\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,\\r\\nbefore Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\r\\nCamden Place could have passed so well!\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap16\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere was one point which Anne, on returning to her family,\\r\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot\\'s\\r\\nbeing in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father\\'s not being\\r\\nin love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it,\\r\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast\\r\\nthe next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence\\r\\non the lady\\'s side of meaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay\\r\\nto have said, that \"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself\\r\\nat all wanted;\" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,\\r\\n\"That must not be any reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.\\r\\nShe is nothing to me, compared with you;\"  and she was in full time\\r\\nto hear her father say, \"My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet,\\r\\nyou have seen nothing of Bath.  You have been here only to be useful.\\r\\nYou must not run away from us now.  You must stay to be acquainted\\r\\nwith Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind,\\r\\nI well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised\\r\\nto see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.\\r\\nHer countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;\\r\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\r\\nin her sister.  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,\\r\\nand promise to stay.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be\\r\\nalone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;\\r\\nhe thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,\\r\\nher complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been\\r\\nusing any thing in particular?\"  \"No, nothing.\"  \"Merely Gowland,\"\\r\\nhe supposed.  \"No, nothing at all.\"  \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\"\\r\\nand added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;\\r\\nyou cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,\\r\\nthe constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been\\r\\nusing it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.\\r\\nYou see how it has carried away her freckles.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIf Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise\\r\\nmight have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne\\r\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must\\r\\ntake its chance.  The evil of a marriage would be much diminished,\\r\\nif Elizabeth were also to marry.  As for herself, she might always\\r\\ncommand a home with Lady Russell.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\r\\non this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs Clay\\r\\nin such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation\\r\\nto her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath\\r\\nwho drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has\\r\\na very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,\\r\\nor more indifferent, towards the others.  His manners were\\r\\nan immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found\\r\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,\\r\\nas she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\"\\r\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\r\\nor estimable man.  Everything united in him; good understanding,\\r\\ncorrect opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.\\r\\nHe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,\\r\\nwithout pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,\\r\\nwithout display; he judged for himself in everything essential,\\r\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.\\r\\nHe was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits\\r\\nor by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,\\r\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value\\r\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of\\r\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.\\r\\nShe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis\\r\\nsaid it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness\\r\\nto sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his\\r\\nthinking of a second choice.  Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot\\r\\noutweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she\\r\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;\\r\\nand it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell\\r\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require\\r\\nmore motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot\\'s great desire of a reconciliation.\\r\\nIn Lady Russell\\'s view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,\\r\\nat a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,\\r\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,\\r\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process\\r\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring\\r\\nin the heyday of youth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,\\r\\nand at last to mention \"Elizabeth.\"  Lady Russell listened, and looked,\\r\\nand made only this cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth! very well;\\r\\ntime will explain.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,\\r\\nfelt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at present.\\r\\nIn that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit\\r\\nof such general observance as \"Miss Elliot,\" that any particularity\\r\\nof attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,\\r\\nit must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.\\r\\nA little delay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact,\\r\\nAnne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that\\r\\nshe was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;\\r\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed\\r\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\r\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHowever it might end, he was without any question their\\r\\npleasantest acquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him;\\r\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme,\\r\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,\\r\\nas herself.  They went through the particulars of their first meeting\\r\\na great many times.  He gave her to understand that he had\\r\\nlooked at her with some earnestness.  She knew it well;\\r\\nand she remembered another person\\'s look also.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion\\r\\nshe perceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance,\\r\\nit must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly\\r\\ninto her father and sister\\'s solicitudes on a subject which\\r\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them.  The Bath paper one morning\\r\\nannounced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\\r\\nand her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort\\r\\nof No. --, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples\\r\\n(in Anne\\'s opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots;\\r\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,\\r\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped\\r\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,\\r\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;\\r\\na wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple\\r\\nand Miss Carteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears\\r\\nall day long.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount,\\r\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties\\r\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\r\\nby letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\\r\\nwhen, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter\\'s\\r\\nat the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.\\r\\nNo letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect\\r\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot\\r\\ndied herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,\\r\\nand, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend\\r\\nthat the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.\\r\\nHow to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted\\r\\nas cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,\\r\\nin a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\r\\nthought unimportant.  \"Family connexions were always worth preserving,\\r\\ngood company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house,\\r\\nfor three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.\\r\\nShe had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her\\r\\nspoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that\\r\\nthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\\r\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote\\r\\na very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,\\r\\nto his right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\r\\ncould admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,\\r\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.\\r\\n\"She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\"\\r\\nThe toils of the business were over, the sweets began.  They visited\\r\\nin Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\\r\\nand the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might\\r\\nbe most visible:  and \"Our cousins in Laura Place,\"--\"Our cousin,\\r\\nLady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been\\r\\nvery agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\r\\nthey created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,\\r\\naccomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired\\r\\nthe name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer\\r\\nfor everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain\\r\\nand so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place\\r\\nbut for her birth.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet\\r\\n\"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak\\r\\nher opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing\\r\\nin themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,\\r\\nas good company, as those who would collect good company around them,\\r\\nthey had their value.  Anne smiled and said,\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,\\r\\nwell-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;\\r\\nthat is what I call good company.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;\\r\\nthat is the best.  Good company requires only birth, education,\\r\\nand manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.\\r\\nBirth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is\\r\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,\\r\\nit will do very well.  My cousin Anne shakes her head.\\r\\nShe is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear cousin\"\\r\\n(sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be fastidious\\r\\nthan almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?\\r\\nWill it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society\\r\\nof those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages\\r\\nof the connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it,\\r\\nthat they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,\\r\\nand as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them\\r\\nwill have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)\\r\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\\r\\nthen recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\\r\\n\"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\r\\nto procure the acquaintance.  I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride\\r\\nthan any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be\\r\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may\\r\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.\\r\\nIn London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,\\r\\nit might be as you say:  but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family\\r\\nwill always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\\r\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.\\r\\nBut here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here\\r\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.\\r\\nYou talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish\\r\\nto believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,\\r\\nwould have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem\\r\\na little different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\"\\r\\n(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)\\r\\n\"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that\\r\\nevery addition to your father\\'s society, among his equals or superiors,\\r\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been\\r\\nlately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;\\r\\nand though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\\r\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience\\r\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her father\\'s getting\\r\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap17\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhile Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\r\\ngood fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance\\r\\nof a very different description.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had called on her former governess, and had heard from her\\r\\nof there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims\\r\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,\\r\\nnow Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\r\\nwhen it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,\\r\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,\\r\\nfeeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,\\r\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\\r\\nand Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want\\r\\nof near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,\\r\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\r\\nher misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMiss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,\\r\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all\\r\\nthat Anne had known of her, till now that their governess\\'s account\\r\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant;\\r\\nand at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs\\r\\ndreadfully involved.  She had had difficulties of every sort\\r\\nto contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\r\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,\\r\\nhad made her for the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath\\r\\non that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,\\r\\nliving in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself\\r\\nthe comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\r\\nfrom Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore\\r\\nlost no time in going.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,\\r\\nor what she intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.\\r\\nShe only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,\\r\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith\\'s lodgings\\r\\nin Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\\r\\nin each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes\\r\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone\\r\\nsince they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person\\r\\nfrom what the other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne\\r\\nfrom the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant\\r\\nlittle woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,\\r\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;\\r\\nand twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton,\\r\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,\\r\\ninfirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee\\r\\nas a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\r\\npassed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\r\\nformer partialities and talking over old times.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\r\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse\\r\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations\\r\\nof the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions\\r\\nof the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\r\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,\\r\\nand Anne\\'s astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine\\r\\na more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith\\'s.  She had been\\r\\nvery fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been\\r\\nused to affluence:  it was gone.  She had no child to connect her\\r\\nwith life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement\\r\\nof perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.\\r\\nHer accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom\\r\\nbehind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\r\\nassistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,\\r\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.\\r\\nYet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had\\r\\nmoments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation\\r\\nand enjoyment.  How could it be?  She watched, observed, reflected,\\r\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\r\\nor of resignation only.  A submissive spirit might be patient,\\r\\na strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;\\r\\nhere was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,\\r\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment\\r\\nwhich carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.\\r\\nIt was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend\\r\\nas one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,\\r\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits\\r\\nhad nearly failed.  She could not call herself an invalid now,\\r\\ncompared with her state on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed,\\r\\nbeen a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,\\r\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\r\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;\\r\\nand all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having\\r\\na regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\r\\nto meet any extraordinary expense.  She had weathered it, however,\\r\\nand could truly say that it had done her good.  It had increased\\r\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.\\r\\nShe had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested\\r\\nattachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\r\\nhad a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been\\r\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,\\r\\na nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house\\r\\nwhen unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.\\r\\n\"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,\\r\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I could\\r\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;\\r\\nand she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,\\r\\npin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,\\r\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\r\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.\\r\\nShe had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those\\r\\nwho can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.\\r\\nShe always takes the right time for applying.  Everybody\\'s heart is open,\\r\\nyou know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,\\r\\nor are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke\\r\\nthoroughly understands when to speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent,\\r\\nsensible woman.  Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has\\r\\na fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her\\r\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\r\\n\\'the best education in the world,\\' know nothing worth attending to.\\r\\nCall it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour\\'s\\r\\nleisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate\\r\\nthat is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one\\r\\nknow one\\'s species better.  One likes to hear what is going on,\\r\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.\\r\\nTo me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,\\r\\n\"I can easily believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities,\\r\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.\\r\\nSuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!\\r\\nAnd it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;\\r\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\r\\nmost interesting or affecting.  What instances must pass before them\\r\\nof ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\\r\\npatience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\r\\nthat ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish\\r\\nthe worth of volumes.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,\\r\\nthough I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.\\r\\nHere and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;\\r\\nbut generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength\\r\\nthat appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience\\r\\nrather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.\\r\\nThere is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\"\\r\\n(speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget\\r\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been\\r\\nwhat he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\r\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.\\r\\nIt was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,\\r\\nand soon added in a different tone--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,\\r\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing\\r\\nMrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\\r\\nfashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report\\r\\nbut of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however.\\r\\nShe has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all\\r\\nthe high-priced things I have in hand now.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne had called several times on her friend, before the existence\\r\\nof such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary\\r\\nto speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning\\r\\nfrom Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\\r\\nfor the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening\\r\\nin Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.\\r\\nThey were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being\\r\\nkept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship\\r\\nwhich had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account\\r\\nwith great alacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening\\r\\nwith an old schoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything\\r\\nrelative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked,\\r\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth\\r\\nwas disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot\\r\\nto be visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith;\\r\\nand who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names\\r\\nare to be met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?\\r\\nThat she is old and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,\\r\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts\\r\\nother people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations\\r\\nare inviting to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady\\r\\ntill to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, I presume,\\r\\nbut that she may hope to see another day.  What is her age?  Forty?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can\\r\\nput off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time\\r\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath\\r\\nto-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked Elizabeth.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"She sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied Anne; \"on the contrary,\\r\\nshe approves it, and has generally taken me when I have\\r\\ncalled on Mrs Smith.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\r\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed Sir Walter.\\r\\n\"Sir Henry Russell\\'s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\\r\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known\\r\\nto convey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!\\r\\nA poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;\\r\\na mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names\\r\\nin the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot,\\r\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\r\\nof England and Ireland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\\r\\nadvisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much,\\r\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friend\\'s\\r\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect\\r\\nto her father prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it\\r\\nto himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow\\r\\nin Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,\\r\\nand no surname of dignity.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course\\r\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.\\r\\nShe had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter\\r\\nand Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship\\'s service themselves,\\r\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,\\r\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;\\r\\nand Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,\\r\\nand Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\r\\nin order to wait on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that\\r\\nsuch an evening could supply from Lady Russell.  To her,\\r\\nits greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of\\r\\nbetween her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,\\r\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.\\r\\nHer kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,\\r\\nsick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.\\r\\nHe thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,\\r\\nmind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet even Lady Russell\\r\\nin a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand\\r\\nso much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated\\r\\nby a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations\\r\\nwhich her friend meant to create.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.\\r\\nShe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of\\r\\nhis deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\r\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,\\r\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.\\r\\nShe would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,\\r\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,\\r\\nof a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,\\r\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned.  Anne heard her,\\r\\nand made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,\\r\\nand gently shook her head.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell,\\r\\n\"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\r\\nand calculations.  I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence\\r\\npay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,\\r\\nI think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.\\r\\nA most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think\\r\\nit might be a very happy one.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects\\r\\nI think highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that\\r\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,\\r\\nthe future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying\\r\\nyour dear mother\\'s place, succeeding to all her rights,\\r\\nand all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be\\r\\nthe highest possible gratification to me.  You are your mother\\'s self\\r\\nin countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you\\r\\nsuch as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing\\r\\nin the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!\\r\\nMy dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt\\r\\nat my time of life!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\\r\\nand, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\\r\\nthis picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\\r\\nwere bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been;\\r\\nof having the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself;\\r\\nof being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again,\\r\\nher home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.\\r\\nLady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter\\r\\nto its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment\\r\\nwith propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,\\r\\nwhat Anne did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking\\r\\nfor himself brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch\\r\\nand of \"Lady Elliot\" all faded away.  She never could accept him.\\r\\nAnd it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\r\\nsave one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\r\\nof such a case, was against Mr Elliot.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThough they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\\r\\nthat she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man,\\r\\nan agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,\\r\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all\\r\\nclear enough.  He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix\\r\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would\\r\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past,\\r\\nif not the present.  The names which occasionally dropt\\r\\nof former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,\\r\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.\\r\\nShe saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling\\r\\nhad been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life\\r\\n(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,\\r\\ncareless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think\\r\\nvery differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,\\r\\ncautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?\\r\\nHow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.\\r\\nThere was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\\r\\nat the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.\\r\\nHer early impressions were incurable.  She prized the frank,\\r\\nthe open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.\\r\\nWarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could\\r\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\r\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\\r\\nnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers\\r\\nin her father\\'s house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well,\\r\\nstood too well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some\\r\\ndegree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see\\r\\nwhat Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet\\r\\nMrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend,\\r\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine\\r\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she\\r\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\r\\nthe hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of\\r\\nthe following autumn.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap18\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath,\\r\\nwas growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.\\r\\nShe wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.\\r\\nIt was three weeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew\\r\\nthat Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be\\r\\nrecovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all\\r\\nvery intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary\\r\\nwas delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,\\r\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s compliments.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her.\\r\\nThey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter.  \"The Crofts have arrived in Bath?\\r\\nThe Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an introduction.\\r\\nI should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate.\\r\\nI know what is due to my tenant.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how\\r\\nthe poor Admiral\\'s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.\\r\\nIt had been begun several days back.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P CLASS=\"noindent\">\\r\\n\"February 1st.<BR>\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know\\r\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.\\r\\nYou must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which,\\r\\nas you well know, affords little to write about.  We have had\\r\\na very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party\\r\\nall the holidays.  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.\\r\\nThe holidays, however, are over at last:  I believe no children ever had\\r\\nsuch long ones.  I am sure I had not.  The house was cleared yesterday,\\r\\nexcept of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear\\r\\nthey have never gone home.  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother\\r\\nto part with them so long.  I do not understand it.  They are\\r\\nnot at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to\\r\\nlike them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.\\r\\nWhat dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt in Bath,\\r\\nwith your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.\\r\\nI have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,\\r\\nexcept Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.\\r\\nBetween ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme\\r\\nas long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.\\r\\nThe carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.\\r\\nWe are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,\\r\\nMrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,\\r\\nwhich is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;\\r\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.\\r\\nI am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted\\r\\nwith him too; but I have my usual luck:  I am always out of the way\\r\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family\\r\\nto be noticed.  What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying\\r\\nwith Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to go away?  But perhaps\\r\\nif she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.\\r\\nLet me know what you think of this.  I do not expect my children\\r\\nto be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House very well,\\r\\nfor a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the Crofts\\r\\nare going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.\\r\\nCharles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility\\r\\nto give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.\\r\\nI do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,\\r\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me\\r\\nin love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P CLASS=\"noindent\">\\r\\n\"Mary M---.<BR>\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has\\r\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat\\r\\nvery much about.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats,\\r\\nyou know, are always worse than anybody\\'s.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSo ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,\\r\\ncontaining nearly as much more.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa\\r\\nbore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal\\r\\nto add.  In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday,\\r\\noffering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,\\r\\naddressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to\\r\\nmake my letter as long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill,\\r\\nand I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.\\r\\nI shall be truly glad to have them back again.  Our neighbourhood\\r\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now for Louisa.\\r\\nI have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.\\r\\nShe and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening\\r\\nwe went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised\\r\\nnot to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited\\r\\nas well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?\\r\\nNeither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,\\r\\nand not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer\\r\\nfrom Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her\\r\\nbefore she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.\\r\\nTrue, upon my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised\\r\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.\\r\\nMrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.\\r\\nWe are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her\\r\\nmarrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;\\r\\nand Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick\\r\\nis expected to-day.  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal\\r\\non his poor sister\\'s account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite\\r\\nwith both.  Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her\\r\\nthe better for having nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth\\r\\nwill say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa;\\r\\nI never could see anything of it.  And this is the end, you see,\\r\\nof Captain Benwick\\'s being supposed to be an admirer of yours.\\r\\nHow Charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\r\\nincomprehensible to me.  I hope he will be more agreeable now.\\r\\nCertainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better\\r\\nthan marrying among the Hayters.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMary need not have feared her sister\\'s being in any degree prepared\\r\\nfor the news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.\\r\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful\\r\\nfor belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\r\\nin the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions\\r\\nof the moment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter\\r\\nwanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses,\\r\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath\\r\\nas it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had\\r\\nlittle curiosity beyond.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,\\r\\n\"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"They come on the Admiral\\'s account.  He is thought to be gouty.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter.  \"Poor old gentleman.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft\\'s\\r\\ntime of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance\\r\\nin such a place as this.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft\\r\\nwill be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.\\r\\nElizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,\\r\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\r\\nshe might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify;\\r\\nbut as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.\\r\\nWe had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.\\r\\nThere are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,\\r\\nI am told, are sailors.  The Crofts will associate with them.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis was Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\'s share of interest in the letter;\\r\\nwhen Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,\\r\\nin an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys,\\r\\nAnne was at liberty.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder\\r\\nhow Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,\\r\\nhad given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\\r\\nShe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything\\r\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure\\r\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited,\\r\\njoyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,\\r\\nfeeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything\\r\\nthat would not suit the other.  Their minds most dissimilar!\\r\\nWhere could have been the attraction?  The answer soon presented itself.\\r\\nIt had been in situation.  They had been thrown together several weeks;\\r\\nthey had been living in the same small family party:  since Henrietta\\'s\\r\\ncoming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,\\r\\nand Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,\\r\\nand Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne\\r\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing\\r\\nthe same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,\\r\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\r\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself.  She did not mean, however,\\r\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary\\r\\nmight have allowed.  She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\r\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\r\\nreceived the same compliment.  He had an affectionate heart.\\r\\nHe must love somebody.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine\\r\\nnaval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.\\r\\nHe would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\r\\nfor Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;\\r\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of\\r\\nLouisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,\\r\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt\\r\\nof its being so.  The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb,\\r\\nmight influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to\\r\\nthe end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\r\\ninfluenced her fate.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible\\r\\nof Captain Wentworth\\'s merits could be allowed to prefer another man,\\r\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;\\r\\nand if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing\\r\\nto be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne\\'s heart\\r\\nbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks\\r\\nwhen she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.\\r\\nShe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.\\r\\nThey were too much like joy, senseless joy!\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,\\r\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.\\r\\nThe visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove\\r\\nwas mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street,\\r\\nperfectly to Sir Walter\\'s satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed\\r\\nof the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more\\r\\nabout the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for,\\r\\nand considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,\\r\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.\\r\\nThey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.\\r\\nHe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft\\r\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk\\r\\nfor her life to do him good.  Anne saw them wherever she went.\\r\\nLady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,\\r\\nand she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.\\r\\nKnowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture\\r\\nof happiness to her.  She always watched them as long as she could,\\r\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,\\r\\nas they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted\\r\\nto see the Admiral\\'s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\r\\nan old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\\r\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft\\r\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;\\r\\nbut it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\\r\\nafter the Croft\\'s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,\\r\\nor her friend\\'s carriage, in the lower part of the town,\\r\\nand return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street\\r\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing\\r\\nby himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,\\r\\nin earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have\\r\\npassed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\r\\nbefore she could catch his notice.  When he did perceive and\\r\\nacknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness\\r\\nand good humour.  \"Ha! is it you?  Thank you, thank you.\\r\\nThis is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you see,\\r\\nstaring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without stopping.\\r\\nBut what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.\\r\\nDid you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must be,\\r\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\r\\nold cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen\\r\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks\\r\\nand mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,\\r\\nwhich they certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\"\\r\\n(laughing heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.\\r\\nWell,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere\\r\\nfor you, or with you?  Can I be of any use?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\r\\nthe little way our road lies together.  I am going home.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes\\r\\nwe will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you\\r\\nas we go along.  There, take my arm; that\\'s right; I do not\\r\\nfeel comfortable if I have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!\"\\r\\ntaking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden;\\r\\nI shall only say, \\'How d\\'ye do?\\' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.\\r\\n\\'How d\\'ye do?\\'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\\r\\nShe, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her heels,\\r\\nas large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the street,\\r\\nyou will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby fellows,\\r\\nboth of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.\\r\\nSophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once:\\r\\ngot away with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story\\r\\nanother time.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.\\r\\nLook, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.\\r\\nAh! the peace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!\\r\\nHow do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.\\r\\nWe are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets\\r\\nfull of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;\\r\\nand then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,\\r\\nand draw in our chairs, and are as snug as if we were at Kellynch,\\r\\nay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.\\r\\nWe do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you,\\r\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.\\r\\nThe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhen they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again\\r\\nfor what he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street\\r\\nto have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,\\r\\nfor the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\r\\ngained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was\\r\\nnot really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way.\\r\\nAs soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.\\r\\nBut first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady\\r\\nI am going to talk about.  That young lady, you know, that we have\\r\\nall been so concerned for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been\\r\\nhappening to.  Her Christian name:  I always forget her Christian name.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\r\\ndid; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies\\r\\nhad not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out\\r\\nif they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well,\\r\\nthis Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.\\r\\nHe was courting her week after week.  The only wonder was,\\r\\nwhat they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;\\r\\nthen, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\r\\nwas set to right.  But even then there was something odd in their\\r\\nway of going on.  Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth,\\r\\nand then he went off to see Edward.  When we came back from Minehead\\r\\nhe was gone down to Edward\\'s, and there he has been ever since.\\r\\nWe have seen nothing of him since November.  Even Sophy could\\r\\nnot understand it.  But now, the matter has taken the strangest turn of all;\\r\\nfor this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being\\r\\nto marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.  You know James Benwick.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,\\r\\nfor I do not know what they should wait for.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne,\\r\\n\"and I understand that he bears an excellent character.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.\\r\\nHe is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are\\r\\nbad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.\\r\\nAn excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active,\\r\\nzealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,\\r\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit\\r\\nfrom Captain Benwick\\'s manners.  I thought them particularly pleasing,\\r\\nand I will answer for it, they would generally please.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too\\r\\npiano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,\\r\\nSophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick\\'s manners better than his.\\r\\nThere is something about Frederick more to our taste.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\r\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,\\r\\nnot at all to represent Captain Benwick\\'s manners as the very best\\r\\nthat could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,\\r\\nshe was beginning to say, \"I was not entering into any comparison\\r\\nof the two friends,\" but the Admiral interrupted her with--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.\\r\\nWe have it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter\\r\\nfrom him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it\\r\\nin a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.\\r\\nI fancy they are all at Uppercross.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore,\\r\\n\"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain\\r\\nWentworth\\'s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.\\r\\nIt did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him\\r\\nand Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out\\r\\non each side equally, and without violence.  I hope his letter\\r\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur\\r\\nfrom beginning to end.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne looked down to hide her smile.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has\\r\\ntoo much spirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better,\\r\\nit is very fit she should have him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing\\r\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s manner of writing to make you suppose\\r\\nhe thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,\\r\\nyou know, without its being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry\\r\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick\\r\\nshould be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that nature\\r\\nin the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;\\r\\ndoes not so much as say, \\'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own\\r\\nfor wondering at it.\\'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,\\r\\nthat he had ever thought of this Miss (what\\'s her name?) for himself.\\r\\nHe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is\\r\\nnothing very unforgiving in that, I think.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant\\r\\nto convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.\\r\\nShe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet\\r\\nattention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Poor Frederick!\" said he at last.  \"Now he must begin all over again\\r\\nwith somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy must write,\\r\\nand beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure.\\r\\nIt would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other\\r\\nMiss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.\\r\\nDo not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap19\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhile Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing\\r\\nhis wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth\\r\\nwas already on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written,\\r\\nhe was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were\\r\\nin Milsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to\\r\\nmake shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it\\r\\nvery desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being\\r\\nconveyed home in Lady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, which was seen waiting\\r\\nat a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,\\r\\nturned into Molland\\'s, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple,\\r\\nto request her assistance.  He soon joined them again, successful,\\r\\nof course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,\\r\\nand would call for them in a few minutes.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer ladyship\\'s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold\\r\\nmore than four with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother;\\r\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\r\\nfor all the three Camden Place ladies.  There could be no doubt\\r\\nas to Miss Elliot.  Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,\\r\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\r\\nbetween the other two.  The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was\\r\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.  But the rain was also\\r\\na mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,\\r\\nand her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne\\'s;\\r\\nand, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\r\\nto walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them\\r\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were\\r\\nobliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay\\r\\nhad a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal,\\r\\nthat his cousin Anne\\'s boots were rather the thickest.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party\\r\\nin the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne,\\r\\nas she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth walking down the street.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\\r\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable\\r\\nand absurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her;\\r\\nit was all confusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded\\r\\nback her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,\\r\\nand Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street\\r\\non a commission of Mrs Clay\\'s.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;\\r\\nshe wanted to see if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself\\r\\nof another motive?  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.\\r\\nShe left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always\\r\\nso much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other\\r\\nof being worse than it was.  She would see if it rained.\\r\\nShe was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,\\r\\nevidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined\\r\\na little below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck\\r\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;\\r\\nhe looked quite red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,\\r\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.\\r\\nShe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.\\r\\nAll the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects\\r\\nof strong surprise were over with her.  Still, however,\\r\\nshe had enough to feel!  It was agitation, pain, pleasure,\\r\\na something between delight and misery.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner\\r\\nwas embarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,\\r\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\\r\\nMutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\\r\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible\\r\\nof his being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being\\r\\nso very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\\r\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.\\r\\nTime had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There was consciousness\\r\\nof some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if he had been\\r\\nsuffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,\\r\\nof the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look\\r\\nof his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth\\r\\nwould not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him,\\r\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side;\\r\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\\r\\nexpecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\r\\nwith unalterable coldness.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nLady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing\\r\\nvery impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.\\r\\nIt was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,\\r\\nand a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd\\r\\nin the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey\\r\\nMiss Elliot.  At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but\\r\\nby the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;\\r\\nand Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne,\\r\\nand by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with them.\\r\\nThe carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer walking.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But it rains.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause he said:  \"Though I came only yesterday,\\r\\nI have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\"\\r\\n(pointing to a new umbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it,\\r\\nif you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent\\r\\nto let me get you a chair.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating\\r\\nher conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,\\r\\nand adding, \"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He will be here in a moment,\\r\\nI am sure.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.  There was no difference\\r\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme,\\r\\nadmiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner\\r\\nof the privileged relation and friend.  He came in with eagerness,\\r\\nappeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,\\r\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away\\r\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased;\\r\\nand in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,\\r\\na gentle and embarrassed glance, and a \"Good morning to you!\"\\r\\nbeing all that she had time for, as she passed away.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth\\'s party\\r\\nbegan talking of them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.\\r\\nHe is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.\\r\\nWhat a very good-looking man!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises,\\r\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes\\r\\nto look at her.  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess\\r\\nI admire her more than her sister.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! so do I.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.\\r\\nAnne is too delicate for them.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have\\r\\nwalked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.\\r\\nShe had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing\\r\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects\\r\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting:\\r\\npraise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,\\r\\nand insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now\\r\\nshe could think only of Captain Wentworth.  She could not understand\\r\\nhis present feelings, whether he were really suffering much\\r\\nfrom disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,\\r\\nshe could not be quite herself.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!\\r\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnother circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long\\r\\nhe meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\\r\\nrecollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more probable\\r\\nthat he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as every body was\\r\\nto meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood\\r\\nsee him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it all be?\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove\\r\\nwas to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost her something to encounter\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance\\r\\nto be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge\\r\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour,\\r\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,\\r\\nin returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him\\r\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\r\\nthe greater part of the street.  There were many other men about him,\\r\\nmany groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.\\r\\nShe looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea\\r\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was\\r\\nnot to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they\\r\\nwere nearly opposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time,\\r\\nanxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,\\r\\nthough not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew\\r\\nwas unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--of\\r\\nher being, in short, intently observing him.  She could thoroughly\\r\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell\\'s mind,\\r\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment\\r\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,\\r\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him\\r\\nof one personal grace!\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAt last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  \"Now, how would she\\r\\nspeak of him?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long;\\r\\nbut I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and\\r\\nMrs Frankland were telling me of last night.  They described\\r\\nthe drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this\\r\\nside of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest\\r\\nand best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number,\\r\\nand I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess\\r\\nI can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,\\r\\neither at her friend or herself.  The part which provoked her most,\\r\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have\\r\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the rooms,\\r\\nwhere he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough\\r\\nfor the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the\\r\\nelegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting\\r\\nmore and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,\\r\\nsick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because\\r\\nher strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.\\r\\nIt was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.\\r\\nOf course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one,\\r\\nand Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have\\r\\na few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should\\r\\nbe satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\\r\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him,\\r\\nLady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened\\r\\nby these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;\\r\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,\\r\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.\\r\\nMrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"By all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come.\\r\\nWho is your party?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was\\r\\nleaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,\\r\\n\"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me\\r\\nto-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding\\r\\nthat I may not have many more visits from you.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment\\'s suspense,\\r\\nwas obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap20\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest\\r\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple\\r\\nmust be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires\\r\\nin the Octagon Room.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door\\r\\nopened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was\\r\\nthe nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.\\r\\nHe was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"How do you do?\"\\r\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries\\r\\nin return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.\\r\\nTheir being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing\\r\\nof their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\\r\\nright to be done.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhile they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth\\r\\ncaught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;\\r\\nand on Captain Wentworth\\'s making a distant bow, she comprehended\\r\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\r\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time\\r\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.\\r\\nThis, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet\\r\\nbetter than nothing, and her spirits improved.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,\\r\\ntheir conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,\\r\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;\\r\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,\\r\\nwith a little smile, a little glow, he said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must have\\r\\nsuffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you\\r\\nat the time.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe assured him that she had not.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"It was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he\\r\\npassed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still\\r\\ntoo painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,\\r\\n\"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences\\r\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.\\r\\nWhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be\\r\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea\\r\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would be\\r\\na very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles\\r\\nand good temper.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, I think,\\r\\nends the resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice\\r\\nover every circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties\\r\\nto contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.\\r\\nThe Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\\r\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter\\'s comfort.\\r\\nAll this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\\r\\nmore than perhaps--\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\\r\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne\\'s cheeks\\r\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however,\\r\\nhe proceeded thus--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\\r\\nand in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove\\r\\nas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,\\r\\nbut Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a reading man;\\r\\nand I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her\\r\\nwith some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude,\\r\\nhad he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,\\r\\nit would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.\\r\\nIt seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\\r\\nuntaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,\\r\\nin his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!\\r\\nFanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her\\r\\nwas indeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such\\r\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nEither from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\\r\\nor from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who,\\r\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,\\r\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless\\r\\nslam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,\\r\\nhad distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,\\r\\nand beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things\\r\\nin a moment.  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;\\r\\nand yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,\\r\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated\\r\\nso far as to say--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa\\'s doing well\\r\\nwas quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\r\\nto be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.\\r\\nShe would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.\\r\\nThe country round Lyme is very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal;\\r\\nand the more I saw, the more I found to admire.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I should very much like to see Lyme again,\" said Anne.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found\\r\\nanything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress\\r\\nyou were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!\\r\\nI should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been\\r\\nstrong disgust.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied Anne;\\r\\n\"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.\\r\\nOne does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,\\r\\nunless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was\\r\\nby no means the case at Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress\\r\\nduring the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal\\r\\nof enjoyment.  So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little,\\r\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty\\r\\nat Lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),\\r\\n\"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared\\r\\nfor whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\"\\r\\nwas the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible\\r\\nwith anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\r\\nto meet her.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot\\r\\nand Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\\r\\nadvanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was\\r\\na group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.\\r\\nShe was divided from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting,\\r\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,\\r\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!\\r\\nShe had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings\\r\\ntowards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;\\r\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful\\r\\ncivilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.\\r\\nShe was in good humour with all.  She had received ideas which\\r\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,\\r\\nas being less happy than herself.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\\r\\nfrom the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw\\r\\nthat he was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into\\r\\nthe Concert Room.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt\\r\\na moment\\'s regret.  But \"they should meet again.  He would look for her,\\r\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,\\r\\nperhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  She was in need of\\r\\na little interval for recollection.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nUpon Lady Russell\\'s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party\\r\\nwas collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,\\r\\nand proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence\\r\\nin their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,\\r\\nand disturb as many people as they could.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nVery, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.\\r\\nElizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back\\r\\nof the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for\\r\\nwhich did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be\\r\\nan insult to the nature of Anne\\'s felicity, to draw any comparison\\r\\nbetween it and her sister\\'s; the origin of one all selfish vanity,\\r\\nof the other all generous attachment.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.\\r\\nHer happiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\\r\\nbut she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of\\r\\nthe last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took\\r\\na hasty range over it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions,\\r\\nand still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see\\r\\nin only one light.  His opinion of Louisa Musgrove\\'s inferiority,\\r\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder\\r\\nat Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;\\r\\nsentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes\\r\\nand more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had\\r\\na heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,\\r\\nwere no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship\\r\\nand regard, but by the tenderness of the past.  Yes, some share of\\r\\nthe tenderness of the past.  She could not contemplate the change\\r\\nas implying less.  He must love her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThese were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied\\r\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;\\r\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,\\r\\nwithout even trying to discern him.  When their places were determined on,\\r\\nand they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see\\r\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;\\r\\nher eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,\\r\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:\\r\\nAnne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,\\r\\nwith the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her.\\r\\nMiss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\\r\\nof Colonel Wallis\\'s gallantry, was quite contented.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne\\'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\r\\nof the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for\\r\\nthe tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,\\r\\nand patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,\\r\\nat least during the first act.  Towards the close of it,\\r\\nin the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained\\r\\nthe words of the song to Mr Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,\\r\\nfor certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of,\\r\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend\\r\\nto understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.\\r\\nYou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\r\\nthese inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,\\r\\ncomprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more\\r\\nof your ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be\\r\\nexamined by a real proficient.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,\"\\r\\nreplied he, \"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot;\\r\\nand I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\r\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished\\r\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are\\r\\nto have next,\" turning to the bill.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer acquaintance\\r\\nwith your character than you are aware of.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since\\r\\nI came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\r\\nin my own family.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you\\r\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted\\r\\nwith you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,\\r\\naccomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.\\r\\nNo one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been\\r\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,\\r\\nis irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered,\\r\\nand questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  He delighted in being asked,\\r\\nbut he would not tell.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention\\r\\nno names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.\\r\\nHe had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot\\r\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited\\r\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\r\\npartiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford,\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s brother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot\\'s company,\\r\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me.\\r\\nVery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared,\\r\\nI would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSuch, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she\\r\\nreceived their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds\\r\\nimmediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.\\r\\nHer father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air\\r\\nthan one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth;\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant\\r\\nin Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBefore Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne\\'s eyes had caught\\r\\nthe right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing\\r\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him,\\r\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.\\r\\nIt seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she\\r\\ndared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance\\r\\nwas recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\r\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhen she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could not have\\r\\ncome nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\\r\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMr Elliot\\'s speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer\\r\\nany inclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change;\\r\\nand, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them\\r\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who\\r\\ndid not choose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell;\\r\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,\\r\\nwhatever she might feel on Lady Russell\\'s account, to shrink from\\r\\nconversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\\r\\nShe was persuaded by Lady Russell\\'s countenance that she had seen him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\r\\nat a distance, but he never came.  The anxious interval\\r\\nwore away unproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again,\\r\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure\\r\\nor of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give\\r\\ndelight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.\\r\\nTo Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.\\r\\nShe could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth\\r\\nonce more, without the interchange of one friendly look.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which\\r\\nwas favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again,\\r\\nand Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner\\r\\nnot to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,\\r\\nand a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place herself\\r\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,\\r\\nmuch more within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so,\\r\\nwithout comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;\\r\\nbut still she did it, and not with much happier effect;\\r\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\r\\nin her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench\\r\\nbefore the concert closed.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSuch was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth\\r\\nwas again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her too;\\r\\nyet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees\\r\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that something\\r\\nmust be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The difference\\r\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room\\r\\nwas strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father,\\r\\nof Lady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?\\r\\nHe began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain\\r\\nWentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;\\r\\nand in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.\\r\\nAnne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,\\r\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\\r\\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked\\r\\nfor a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down\\r\\ntowards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;\\r\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.\\r\\nIt came from Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,\\r\\nto explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have\\r\\na general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse;\\r\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;\\r\\nand when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look\\r\\nas she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth,\\r\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"He must wish her good night;\\r\\nhe was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck\\r\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\\r\\nand he was gone directly.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nJealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it\\r\\na week ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.\\r\\nBut, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.\\r\\nHow was such jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?\\r\\nHow, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,\\r\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think\\r\\nof Mr Elliot\\'s attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap21\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\r\\nof going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home\\r\\nat the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid\\r\\nMr Elliot was almost a first object.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of\\r\\nthe mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,\\r\\nperhaps compassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\r\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which\\r\\nhe seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,\\r\\nby his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.  It was altogether\\r\\nvery extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.\\r\\nHow she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,\\r\\nwas not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;\\r\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,\\r\\nher affection would be his for ever.  Their union, she believed,\\r\\ncould not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nPrettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,\\r\\ncould never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne\\r\\nwas sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.\\r\\nIt was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning\\r\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,\\r\\nthough it had been an appointment.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAn account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne\\'s recollections\\r\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\r\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell\\r\\nshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,\\r\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had\\r\\nalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\\r\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\r\\nthan Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\r\\nof the company.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath\\r\\nwas well know by name to Mrs Smith.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The little Durands were there, I conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths\\r\\nopen to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.\\r\\nThey never miss a concert.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were\\r\\nin the room.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,\\r\\nwith the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I do not know.  I do not think they were.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses,\\r\\nI know; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own circle;\\r\\nfor as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,\\r\\nround the orchestra, of course.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me\\r\\nin every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses\\r\\nto be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,\\r\\nfor hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen\\r\\nvery little.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.\\r\\nThere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,\\r\\nand this you had.  You were a large party in yourselves,\\r\\nand you wanted nothing beyond.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious\\r\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,\\r\\nthat the object only had been deficient.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you\\r\\nhad a pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see\\r\\nhow the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable\\r\\nto listen to.  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\r\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\r\\nin the world, the person who interests you at this present time\\r\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA blush overspread Anne\\'s cheeks.  She could say nothing.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause,\\r\\n\"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness\\r\\nin coming to me this morning.  It is really very good of you\\r\\nto come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\r\\nupon your time.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and\\r\\nconfusion excited by her friend\\'s penetration, unable to imagine\\r\\nhow any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.\\r\\nAfter another short silence--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?\\r\\nDoes he know that I am in Bath?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment\\'s reflection\\r\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it instantaneously;\\r\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,\\r\\nmore composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith, gravely,\\r\\n\"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.\\r\\nHad I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"To confess the truth,\" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual\\r\\nair of cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.\\r\\nI want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.\\r\\nHe can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\\r\\nmy dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,\\r\\nof course it is done.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\r\\nto be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect\\r\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,\\r\\na greater right to influence him, than is really the case.\\r\\nI am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.\\r\\nYou must consider me only as Mr Elliot\\'s relation.  If in that light\\r\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,\\r\\nI beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.\\r\\nI ought to have waited for official information.  But now, my dear\\r\\nMiss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.\\r\\nNext week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to\\r\\nthink it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on\\r\\nMr Elliot\\'s good fortune.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.\\r\\nI assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\r\\nwill be settled any week.  I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.\\r\\nI should like to know why you imagine I am?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,\\r\\nshook her head, and exclaimed--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew\\r\\nwhat you were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,\\r\\nwhen the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know,\\r\\nwe women never mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us,\\r\\nthat every man is refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?\\r\\nLet me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for\\r\\nmy former friend.  Where can you look for a more suitable match?\\r\\nWhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?\\r\\nLet me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\r\\nfrom Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot\\'s wife has not been dead much above\\r\\nhalf a year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\r\\nto any one.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly,\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.\\r\\nDo not forget me when you are married, that\\'s all.  Let him know me to be\\r\\na friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,\\r\\nwhich it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements\\r\\nof his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.\\r\\nNinety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of course,\\r\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss Elliot,\\r\\nI hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense\\r\\nto understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be\\r\\nshipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters,\\r\\nand safe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be\\r\\nmisled by others to his ruin.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin.\\r\\nHe seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open\\r\\nto dangerous impressions.  I consider him with great respect.\\r\\nI have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,\\r\\nto do otherwise.  But I have not known him long; and he is not a man,\\r\\nI think, to be known intimately soon.  Will not this manner\\r\\nof speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?\\r\\nSurely this must be calm enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.\\r\\nShould he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine\\r\\nhe has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you\\r\\nI shall not.  I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which\\r\\nyou have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert\\r\\nof last night might afford:  not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\\r\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly\\r\\nhave believed so soon in Mr Elliot\\'s failure, but from the perception\\r\\nof there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,\\r\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,\\r\\neager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith\\r\\nshould have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have\\r\\nreceived the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much\\r\\nyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\r\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;\\r\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\r\\nin the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And has it indeed been spoken of?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\r\\nyou called yesterday?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed\\r\\nno one in particular.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye,\\r\\nhad a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way\\r\\nto let you in.  She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday;\\r\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.\\r\\nShe had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.\\r\\nShe sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\"\\r\\n\"The whole history,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make\\r\\na very long history, I think, of one such little article\\r\\nof unfounded news.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Smith said nothing.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having\\r\\nthis claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\r\\nin any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?\\r\\nShall I take any message?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment,\\r\\nand under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured\\r\\nto interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you,\\r\\nI have nothing to trouble you with.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I did.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Not before he was married, I suppose?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And--were you much acquainted?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Intimately.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.\\r\\nI have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.\\r\\nWas he at all such as he appears now?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s answer,\\r\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\\r\\nand Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\\r\\nThey were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her\\r\\nnatural tone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers\\r\\nI have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.\\r\\nI have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.\\r\\nThere were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates\\r\\nto be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.\\r\\nEven the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,\\r\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined;\\r\\nI think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted\\r\\nwith Mr Elliot\\'s real character.  Though I fully believe that,\\r\\nat present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,\\r\\nthere is no saying what may happen.  You might, some time or other,\\r\\nbe differently affected towards him.  Hear the truth, therefore,\\r\\nnow, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr Elliot is a man without heart\\r\\nor conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks\\r\\nonly of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty\\r\\nof any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without\\r\\nrisk of his general character.  He has no feeling for others.\\r\\nThose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,\\r\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.\\r\\nHe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.\\r\\nOh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne\\'s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,\\r\\nand in a calmer manner, she added,\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry woman.\\r\\nBut I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.\\r\\nI will only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.\\r\\nHe was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,\\r\\nand thought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed\\r\\nbefore our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too,\\r\\nbecame excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained\\r\\nthe highest opinion of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not\\r\\nthink very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,\\r\\nand much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost\\r\\nalways together.  We were principally in town, living in very good style.\\r\\nHe was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;\\r\\nhe had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do\\r\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home\\r\\nwith us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.\\r\\nMy poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,\\r\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse\\r\\nwas open to him; I know that he often assisted him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot\\'s life,\"\\r\\nsaid Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.\\r\\nIt must have been about the same time that he became known to\\r\\nmy father and sister.  I never knew him myself; I only heard of him;\\r\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to\\r\\nmy father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,\\r\\nwhich I never could quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed\\r\\nto announce a different sort of man.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith.  \"He had been\\r\\nintroduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him,\\r\\nbut I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited\\r\\nand encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,\\r\\nperhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,\\r\\nI knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors and againsts;\\r\\nI was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though\\r\\nI did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,\\r\\nindeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,\\r\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer\\r\\nany question you may wish to put.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her.\\r\\nI have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should\\r\\nlike to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight\\r\\nmy father\\'s acquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed\\r\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life,\\r\\nhad one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker\\r\\nprocess than the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.\\r\\nHe was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;\\r\\nand I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course\\r\\nI cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities\\r\\nand invitations, were designing a match between the heir\\r\\nand the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match\\r\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.\\r\\nThat was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.\\r\\nHe told me the whole story.  He had no concealments with me.\\r\\nIt was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,\\r\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;\\r\\nand that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father\\r\\nand sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought\\r\\nvery affectionately of the other.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes\\r\\nspoke of me to Mr Elliot?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,\\r\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe checked herself just in time.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\"\\r\\ncried Anne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.\\r\\nI could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where\\r\\ndear self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon;\\r\\nI have interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?\\r\\nThe circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes\\r\\nto his character.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Smith hesitated a little here.  \"Oh! those things are too common.\\r\\nWhen one lives in the world, a man or woman\\'s marrying for money\\r\\nis too common to strike one as it ought.  I was very young,\\r\\nand associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,\\r\\ngay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.\\r\\nI think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\r\\nother notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible\\r\\nin what Mr Elliot was doing.  \\'To do the best for himself,\\'\\r\\npassed as a duty.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But was not she a very low woman?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money,\\r\\nwas all that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather\\r\\nhad been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman,\\r\\nhad had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,\\r\\nthrown by chance into Mr Elliot\\'s company, and fell in love with him;\\r\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,\\r\\nwith respect to her birth.  All his caution was spent in being secured\\r\\nof the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.\\r\\nDepend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation\\r\\nin life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.\\r\\nHis chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour\\r\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare,\\r\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his\\r\\nfor fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;\\r\\nbut I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say\\r\\non that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,\\r\\nfor what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne.  \"You have asserted\\r\\nnothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago.\\r\\nThis is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.\\r\\nI am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary;\\r\\nstay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\r\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\\r\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.\\r\\nThe box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it\\r\\nas she unlocked it, said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;\\r\\na small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.\\r\\nThe letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him\\r\\nbefore our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.\\r\\nBut he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;\\r\\nand when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others\\r\\nstill more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,\\r\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.\\r\\nHere it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little\\r\\nsatisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document\\r\\nof former intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad\\r\\nthat I can produce it.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThis was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\"\\r\\nand dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers me.\\r\\nI wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have\\r\\nlived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.\\r\\nAt present, believe me, I have no need of your services,\\r\\nbeing in cash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.\\r\\nThey are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them\\r\\nthis summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,\\r\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.\\r\\nThe baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;\\r\\nhe is quite fool enough.  If he does, however, they will leave me in peace,\\r\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse\\r\\nthan last year.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of Walter\\r\\nI can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me\\r\\nwith my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,\\r\\nto be only yours truly,--Wm. Elliot.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSuch a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow;\\r\\nand Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot\\r\\nthe exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\\r\\nBut it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.\\r\\nCan any thing be stronger?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\r\\nof finding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect\\r\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,\\r\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,\\r\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,\\r\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\r\\nwhich she had been meditating over, and say--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing\\r\\nyou were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Can you really?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,\\r\\nand I will shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again,\\r\\nbut I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what\\r\\nhe is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.\\r\\nHe truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family\\r\\nare very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority:\\r\\nhis friend Colonel Wallis.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;\\r\\nit takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream\\r\\nis as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\r\\nis easily moved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis\\r\\nof his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be,\\r\\nin himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;\\r\\nbut Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom\\r\\nhe tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.\\r\\nShe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all\\r\\nto her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,\\r\\nvery naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday evening, my good friend\\r\\nMrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.\\r\\nWhen I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was\\r\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.\\r\\nMr Elliot\\'s having any views on me will not in the least account\\r\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.\\r\\nThat was all prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on\\r\\nthe most friendly terms when I arrived.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information\\r\\nin such a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\r\\nof so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,\\r\\ncan hardly have much truth left.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of\\r\\nthe general credit due, by listening to some particulars\\r\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.\\r\\nNobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  He had seen you\\r\\nindeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without\\r\\nknowing it to be you.  So says my historian, at least.  Is this true?\\r\\nDid he see you last summer or autumn, \\'somewhere down in the west,\\'\\r\\nto use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.\\r\\nI happened to be at Lyme.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\\r\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then\\r\\nat Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\r\\nto meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot,\\r\\nand from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive\\r\\nin his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier,\\r\\nwhich I will now explain.  If there is anything in my story which you know\\r\\nto be either false or improbable, stop me.  My account states,\\r\\nthat your sister\\'s friend, the lady now staying with you,\\r\\nwhom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter\\r\\nas long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves),\\r\\nand has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,\\r\\nhandsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation\\r\\nand manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter\\'s acquaintance,\\r\\nof her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise\\r\\nthat Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHere Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,\\r\\nand she continued--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\\r\\nlong before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye\\r\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then\\r\\nvisit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest\\r\\nin watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\\r\\nfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,\\r\\nColonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,\\r\\nand the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand,\\r\\nthat time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot\\'s opinions\\r\\nas to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion\\r\\nhe is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money\\r\\nas he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\r\\nor indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\r\\nupon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on\\r\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.\\r\\nHe cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess,\\r\\ntherefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\r\\nvery agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution\\r\\nof coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here\\r\\nfor a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,\\r\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\r\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady\\r\\nif he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends\\r\\nas the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist\\r\\nin every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis\\r\\nwas to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.\\r\\nMr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,\\r\\nas you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was\\r\\nhis constant object, and his only object (till your arrival\\r\\nadded another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.\\r\\nHe omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,\\r\\ncalled at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.\\r\\nYou can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,\\r\\nperhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\r\\nwhat I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive\\r\\nin the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\r\\nmust ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me.\\r\\nI know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot,\\r\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.\\r\\nI have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.\\r\\nI should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability\\r\\nof the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger\\r\\nto be lessening or not.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Lessening, I understand,\" replied Mrs Smith.  \"He thinks Mrs Clay\\r\\nafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed\\r\\nas she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent\\r\\nsome time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\r\\nwhile she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea,\\r\\nas nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\r\\nwhen you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.\\r\\nA scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis\\'s understanding, by all accounts;\\r\\nbut my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  \\'Why, to be sure,\\r\\nma\\'am,\\' said she, \\'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.\\'\\r\\nAnd, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart,\\r\\nis a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter\\'s making a second match.\\r\\nShe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;\\r\\nand (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have\\r\\nsome flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through\\r\\nMrs Wallis\\'s recommendation?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little\\r\\nthoughtfulness.  \"It will be more painful to me in some respects\\r\\nto be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.\\r\\nMy line of conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently\\r\\na disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had\\r\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBut Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away\\r\\nfrom her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest\\r\\nof her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied\\r\\nagainst him; but her attention was now called to the explanation\\r\\nof those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,\\r\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,\\r\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;\\r\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\r\\nby Mr Elliot\\'s marriage) they had been as before always together,\\r\\nand Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.\\r\\nMrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender\\r\\nof throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income\\r\\nhad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\\r\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.\\r\\nFrom his wife\\'s account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been\\r\\na man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\\r\\nunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\\r\\nled by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by\\r\\nhis marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification\\r\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\\r\\n(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),\\r\\nand beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself\\r\\nto be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend\\'s\\r\\nprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\\r\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths\\r\\naccordingly had been ruined.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.\\r\\nThey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\r\\nof their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot\\'s had better not be tried;\\r\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\r\\nwas fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot\\'s regard,\\r\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had\\r\\nappointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,\\r\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\\r\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such\\r\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\\r\\nwithout corresponding indignation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to\\r\\nurgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same\\r\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,\\r\\nunder a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference\\r\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture\\r\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,\\r\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  She had a great deal\\r\\nto listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae\\r\\nof distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been\\r\\nmerely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.\\r\\nAnne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only\\r\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend\\'s\\r\\nusual state of mind.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\r\\nof particular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that\\r\\nsome property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been\\r\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\r\\nof its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;\\r\\nand this property, though not large, would be enough to make\\r\\nher comparatively rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.\\r\\nMr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,\\r\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\r\\nbodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.\\r\\nShe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,\\r\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.\\r\\nThis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\\r\\nTo feel that she ought to be in better circumstances,\\r\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it,\\r\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims,\\r\\nwas hard to bear.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne\\'s good offices\\r\\nwith Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation\\r\\nof their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;\\r\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,\\r\\nsince he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,\\r\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\r\\nhe loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne\\'s feelings,\\r\\nas far as the observances due to Mr Elliot\\'s character would allow,\\r\\nwhen Anne\\'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\r\\nthe face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope\\r\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least\\r\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAfter listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but\\r\\nexpress some surprise at Mrs Smith\\'s having spoken of him so favourably\\r\\nin the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to recommend\\r\\nand praise him!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\\r\\nI considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet\\r\\nhave made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him,\\r\\nthan if he had been your husband.  My heart bled for you,\\r\\nas I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,\\r\\nand with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.\\r\\nHe was very unkind to his first wife.  They were wretched together.\\r\\nBut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.\\r\\nI was willing to hope that you must fare better.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\r\\nof having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea\\r\\nof the misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that\\r\\nshe might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such\\r\\na supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had\\r\\ndisclosed all, too late?\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;\\r\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\\r\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning,\\r\\nwas, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\r\\neverything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap22\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point,\\r\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.\\r\\nThere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as\\r\\nopposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;\\r\\nand the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief\\r\\nhe might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.\\r\\nPity for him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.\\r\\nIn every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,\\r\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned\\r\\nfor the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling;\\r\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,\\r\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing\\r\\nhow to avert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own\\r\\nknowledge of him.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\r\\nfor not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was\\r\\na reward indeed springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her\\r\\nwhat no one else could have done.  Could the knowledge have\\r\\nbeen extended through her family?  But this was a vain idea.\\r\\nShe must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,\\r\\nand having done her best, wait the event with as much composure\\r\\nas possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be\\r\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell;\\r\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,\\r\\nescaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them\\r\\na long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,\\r\\nand felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\nwith affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;\\r\\nso Mrs Clay says, at least.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\r\\nfor an invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him;\\r\\nfor your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game\\r\\nto be soon overcome by a gentleman\\'s hints.  However, when I found\\r\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\r\\nthis morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit\\r\\nan opportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to\\r\\nso much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so pleasantly.\\r\\nMr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,\\r\\nto turn her eyes towards Anne.  \"Exactly like father and son!\\r\\nDear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body\\'s words.  If you will have such\\r\\nideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\r\\nbeing beyond those of other men.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\\r\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.\\r\\nI did invite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.\\r\\nWhen I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park\\r\\nfor the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew\\r\\nsuch pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\r\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\r\\nher prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate\\r\\nthe sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,\\r\\nplacid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\r\\nof devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have\\r\\ndone otherwise.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTo Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;\\r\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.\\r\\nShe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,\\r\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference\\r\\nto her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;\\r\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith,\\r\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,\\r\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\r\\na remonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape\\r\\nall enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\r\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,\\r\\nas quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\r\\nbeen gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded,\\r\\nand more cool, than she had been the night before.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\r\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much\\r\\nto be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:\\r\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\r\\nto kindle his modest cousin\\'s vanity; he found, at least, that it was\\r\\nnot to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\r\\namong the too-commanding claims of the others.  He little surmised\\r\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,\\r\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\r\\nwhich were least excusable.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath\\r\\nthe next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part\\r\\nof two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of\\r\\nhis return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.\\r\\nIt was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her;\\r\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,\\r\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.\\r\\nIt was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\r\\non her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources\\r\\nof mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay\\'s selfishness was\\r\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded\\r\\nfor the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot\\'s\\r\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOn Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell,\\r\\nand accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\\r\\ndirectly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out\\r\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which\\r\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.\\r\\nShe saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk\\r\\nof spending the morning in Rivers Street.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love.\\r\\nOh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,\\r\\nand pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself\\r\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\\r\\nLady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.\\r\\nYou need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.\\r\\nI used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her\\r\\nat the concert.  Something so formal and <i>arrang\\xe9</i> in her air!\\r\\nand she sits so upright!  My best love, of course.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say,\\r\\nthat I mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message;\\r\\nbut I shall only leave my card.  Morning visits are never fair\\r\\nby women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.\\r\\nIf she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;\\r\\nbut last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it be?\\r\\nAnne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot,\\r\\nwould have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.\\r\\nAfter the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,\\r\\nand \"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove\" were ushered into the room.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;\\r\\nbut Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry\\r\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon\\r\\nas it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived\\r\\nwith any views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\r\\nwere able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.\\r\\nThey were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were\\r\\nat the White Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood;\\r\\nbut till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into\\r\\nthe other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,\\r\\nAnne could not draw upon Charles\\'s brain for a regular history\\r\\nof their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints\\r\\nof particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary,\\r\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,\\r\\nand Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,\\r\\nintelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw\\r\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme\\r\\nhad received its first impulse by Captain Harville\\'s wanting to\\r\\ncome to Bath on business.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago;\\r\\nand by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed\\r\\ncoming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\r\\nvery much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear\\r\\nto be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two\\r\\neverything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then,\\r\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother.  His mother had\\r\\nsome old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought\\r\\na good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes\\r\\nfor herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being\\r\\nhis mother\\'s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy\\r\\nto Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it\\r\\nby way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night before.\\r\\nMrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with\\r\\nMr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne\\'s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\r\\nfor Henrietta\\'s wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined\\r\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\r\\nthe marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,\\r\\nvery recently, (since Mary\\'s last letter to herself), Charles Hayter\\r\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\r\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years; and that\\r\\non the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty\\r\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question,\\r\\nthe two families had consented to the young people\\'s wishes,\\r\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,\\r\\nquite as soon as Louisa\\'s.  \"And a very good living it was,\"\\r\\nCharles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross,\\r\\nand in a very fine country:   fine part of Dorsetshire.\\r\\nIn the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,\\r\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous\\r\\nthan the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get\\r\\na special recommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,\"\\r\\nhe observed, \"Charles is too cool about sporting. That\\'s the worst of him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad\\r\\nthat this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve\\r\\nequally well, and who have always been such good friends,\\r\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the\\r\\nother--that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.\\r\\nI hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,\\r\\nbut he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming down with\\r\\nmoney--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,\\r\\nand it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not mean to say\\r\\nthey have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should have\\r\\ndaughters\\' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,\\r\\nliberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta\\'s match.\\r\\nShe never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice,\\r\\nnor think enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to\\r\\nthe value of the property.  It is a very fair match, as times go;\\r\\nand I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,\\r\\n\"should be happy in their children\\'s marriages.  They do everything\\r\\nto confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people\\r\\nto be in such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free\\r\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\r\\nand misery, both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa\\r\\nperfectly recovered now?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered;\\r\\nbut she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing\\r\\nor dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to shut the door\\r\\na little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;\\r\\nand Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,\\r\\nall day long.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne could not help laughing.  \"That cannot be much to your taste,\\r\\nI know,\" said she; \"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think\\r\\nI am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\r\\npleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can\\r\\nbut get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done him\\r\\nno harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.\\r\\nI got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.\\r\\nWe had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in\\r\\nmy father\\'s great barns; and he played his part so well\\r\\nthat I have liked him the better ever since.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles\\'s\\r\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had\\r\\nheard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross,\\r\\nand rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,\\r\\nher sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly\\r\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want\\r\\nto lessen theirs.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was\\r\\nin excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,\\r\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law\\'s carriage\\r\\nwith four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,\\r\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,\\r\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,\\r\\nas they were detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister,\\r\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\r\\ndrawing-rooms.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nElizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.\\r\\nShe felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\r\\nto dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,\\r\\nthe reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those\\r\\nwho had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.\\r\\nIt was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,\\r\\nand then Elizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions:\\r\\n\"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess\\r\\nto give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;\\r\\ndid not even ask her own sister\\'s family, though they were here a month:\\r\\nand I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;\\r\\nput her quite out of her way.  I am sure she would rather not come;\\r\\nshe cannot feel easy with us.  I will ask them all for an evening;\\r\\nthat will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.\\r\\nThey have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted\\r\\nto come to-morrow evening.  It shall be a regular party, small,\\r\\nbut most elegant.\"  And this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation\\r\\nwas given to the two present, and promised for the absent,\\r\\nMary was as completely satisfied.  She was particularly asked\\r\\nto meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\\r\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not\\r\\nhave received a more gratifying attention.  Miss Elliot was to have\\r\\nthe honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;\\r\\nand Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her\\r\\nand Henrietta directly.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.\\r\\nThey all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;\\r\\nbut Anne convinced herself that a day\\'s delay of the intended communication\\r\\ncould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart,\\r\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,\\r\\nwith an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,\\r\\nand Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly\\r\\nin that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,\\r\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\r\\never liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove\\'s real affection had been won\\r\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness,\\r\\nand a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more,\\r\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home.  She was entreated\\r\\nto give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day\\r\\nand all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,\\r\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,\\r\\nand on Charles\\'s leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove\\'s\\r\\nhistory of Louisa, and to Henrietta\\'s of herself, giving opinions\\r\\non business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\\r\\nwhich Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\\r\\nfrom finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying\\r\\nto convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary,\\r\\nwell amused as she generally was, in her station at a window\\r\\noverlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have\\r\\nher moments of imagining.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nA morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party\\r\\nin an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes\\r\\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there\\r\\nhalf an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,\\r\\nseemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends\\r\\nwere seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with\\r\\nCaptains Harville and Wentworth.  The appearance of the latter\\r\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment.  It was impossible\\r\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\r\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\r\\nTheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;\\r\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared\\r\\nfrom his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\\r\\nhastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.\\r\\nHe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,\\r\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\"Surely,\\r\\nif there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts\\r\\nmust understand each other ere long.  We are not boy and girl,\\r\\nto be captiously irritable, misled by every moment\\'s inadvertence,\\r\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness.\"  And yet,\\r\\na few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company\\r\\nwith each other, under their present circumstances, could only be\\r\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\r\\nmischievous kind.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay,\\r\\nI am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.\\r\\nI saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed\\r\\ndeep in talk.  Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.\\r\\nIt is Mr Elliot himself.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.\\r\\nHe was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back\\r\\ntill to-morrow.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAs she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,\\r\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\\r\\nthat she had said so much, simple as it was.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\\r\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\\r\\nstill more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne\\r\\nto come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,\\r\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned,\\r\\nhowever, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\r\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves\\r\\nquite in the secret.  It was evident that the report concerning her\\r\\nhad spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure\\r\\nthat it would now spread farther.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Do come, Anne,\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too late\\r\\nif you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking hands.\\r\\nHe is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to have\\r\\nforgot all about Lyme.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTo pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,\\r\\nAnne did move quietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain\\r\\nthat it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,\\r\\nbefore he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off\\r\\non the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\r\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\r\\nof totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot,\\r\\ncertainly.  He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all,\\r\\nor I may be mistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\\r\\nrecomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off,\\r\\nand then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.\\r\\nI have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.\\r\\nA\\'n\\'t I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\\r\\nIt holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will\\r\\nnot be sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.\\r\\nHave not I done well, mother?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\r\\nfor the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary\\r\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?\\r\\nTake a box for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged\\r\\nto Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked\\r\\nto meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all\\r\\nthe principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?\\r\\nHow can you be so forgetful?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" replied Charles, \"what\\'s an evening party?\\r\\nNever worth remembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner,\\r\\nI think, if he had wanted to see us.  You may do as you like,\\r\\nbut I shall go to the play.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,\\r\\nwhen you promised to go.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word\\r\\n\\'happy.\\'  There was no promise.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.\\r\\nWe were asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always\\r\\nsuch a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.\\r\\nNothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.\\r\\nWe are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,\\r\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  Every attention\\r\\nis due to Mr Elliot.  Consider, my father\\'s heir:  the future\\r\\nrepresentative of the family.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Don\\'t talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles.\\r\\n\"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\r\\nto the rising sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father,\\r\\nI should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.\\r\\nWhat is Mr Elliot to me?\"  The careless expression was life to Anne,\\r\\nwho saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and\\r\\nlistening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought\\r\\nhis enquiring eyes from Charles to herself.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCharles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\\r\\nand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\\r\\ninvariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting\\r\\nto make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,\\r\\nshe should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\\r\\nwithout her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back\\r\\nand change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided,\\r\\nand we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father\\'s;\\r\\nand I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,\\r\\nif Miss Anne could not be with us.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much\\r\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma\\'am, the party at home\\r\\n(excepting on Mary\\'s account) would not be the smallest impediment.\\r\\nI have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy\\r\\nto change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better\\r\\nnot be attempted, perhaps.\"  She had spoken it; but she trembled\\r\\nwhen it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,\\r\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;\\r\\nCharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,\\r\\nby persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;\\r\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,\\r\\nand taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy\\r\\nthe evening parties of the place.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.\\r\\nI am no card-player.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards;\\r\\nbut time makes many changes.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she\\r\\nhardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments\\r\\nhe said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,\\r\\n\"It is a period, indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWhether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne\\'s imagination\\r\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds\\r\\nhe had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,\\r\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,\\r\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else\\r\\nshould come in.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready,\\r\\nand tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known\\r\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,\\r\\nin preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own\\r\\nsensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,\\r\\nwherewith to pity her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTheir preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds\\r\\nwere heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open\\r\\nfor Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give\\r\\na general chill.  Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked\\r\\nsaw symptoms of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety\\r\\nof the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,\\r\\nor insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.\\r\\nHow mortifying to feel that it was so!\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth\\r\\nwas acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.\\r\\nShe even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\\r\\nElizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel\\r\\nexplained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying\\r\\nthe proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which\\r\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves.\\r\\n\"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party.\"\\r\\nIt was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had\\r\\nprovided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,\\r\\nwith a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and\\r\\none card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The truth was,\\r\\nthat Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\\r\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.\\r\\nThe past was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth\\r\\nwould move about well in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given,\\r\\nand Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\\r\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,\\r\\nbut not to Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had\\r\\nwith such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which\\r\\nit had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather\\r\\nthan gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.\\r\\nShe knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\\r\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement\\r\\nfor all the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card\\r\\nin his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Only think of Elizabeth\\'s including everybody!\" whispered Mary\\r\\nvery audibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!\\r\\nYou see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\\r\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,\\r\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits,\\r\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while\\r\\nAnne belonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine,\\r\\nand give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been\\r\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,\\r\\nand fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent\\r\\nas she chose.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nPromising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,\\r\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place,\\r\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\r\\nof Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow\\'s party, the frequent enumeration\\r\\nof the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all\\r\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\r\\nof its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending\\r\\nquestion, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?  They were\\r\\nreckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\r\\nnever appeased for five minutes together.  She generally thought\\r\\nhe would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case\\r\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,\\r\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\\r\\nto let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot\\r\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath,\\r\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\r\\nfrom the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her\\r\\nthere was guilt in Mrs Clay\\'s face as she listened.  It was transient:\\r\\ncleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there\\r\\nthe consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,\\r\\nor some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend\\r\\n(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\r\\non Sir Walter.  She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable\\r\\nimitation of nature:--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise\\r\\nI met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.\\r\\nHe turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented\\r\\nsetting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;\\r\\nfor I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer\\r\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return.\\r\\nHe wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.\\r\\nHe was full of \\'to-morrow,\\' and it is very evident that I have been\\r\\nfull of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension\\r\\nof your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have\\r\\ngone so entirely out of my head.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap23\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOne day only had passed since Anne\\'s conversation with Mrs Smith;\\r\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched\\r\\nby Mr Elliot\\'s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,\\r\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer\\r\\nher explanatory visit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be\\r\\nwith the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted,\\r\\nand Mr Elliot\\'s character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade\\'s head,\\r\\nmust live another day.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe could not keep her appointment punctually, however;\\r\\nthe weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain\\r\\non her friends\\' account, and felt it very much on her own,\\r\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk.  When she reached the White Hart,\\r\\nand made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself\\r\\nneither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.\\r\\nThe party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,\\r\\nand Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard\\r\\nthat Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment\\r\\nit had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest\\r\\ninjunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there\\r\\ntill they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,\\r\\nbe outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once\\r\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\r\\ntasting a little before the morning closed.  There was no delay,\\r\\nno waste of time.  She was deep in the happiness of such misery,\\r\\nor the misery of such happiness, instantly.  Two minutes after\\r\\nher entering the room, Captain Wentworth said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now,\\r\\nif you will give me materials.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,\\r\\nand nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest\\r\\ndaughter\\'s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\r\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.\\r\\nAnne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,\\r\\nas Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,\\r\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,\\r\\n\"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again\\r\\nto talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day,\\r\\nand what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred\\r\\nto my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what\\r\\nI said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded\\r\\nto think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style\\r\\nof open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every advantage\\r\\nof taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give,\\r\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft\\r\\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,\\r\\nit was very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\r\\ntoo much self-occupied to hear.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"And so, ma\\'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove,\\r\\nin her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,\\r\\nyet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,\\r\\nfor Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was\\r\\npretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,\\r\\nand make the best of it, as many others have done before them.\\r\\nAt any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"That is precisely what I was going to observe,\" cried Mrs Croft.\\r\\n\"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,\\r\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be\\r\\ninvolved in a long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her\\r\\nfinish her speech, \"there is nothing I so abominate for young people\\r\\nas a long engagement.  It is what I always protested against\\r\\nfor my children.  It is all very well, I used to say, for young people\\r\\nto be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\r\\nin six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, dear ma\\'am,\" said Mrs Croft, \"or an uncertain engagement,\\r\\nan engagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing\\r\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying,\\r\\nI hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents\\r\\nshould prevent as far as they can.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application\\r\\nto herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same\\r\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\\r\\nlistening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,\\r\\none quick, conscious look at her.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,\\r\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\r\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,\\r\\nbut Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,\\r\\nher mind was in confusion.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,\\r\\nnow left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him,\\r\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible\\r\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her\\r\\nwith a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,\\r\\n\"Come to me, I have something to say;\" and the unaffected,\\r\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\r\\nthan he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself\\r\\nand went to him.  The window at which he stood was at the other end\\r\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer\\r\\nto Captain Wentworth\\'s table, not very near.  As she joined him,\\r\\nCaptain Harville\\'s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful\\r\\nexpression which seemed its natural character.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying\\r\\na small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Certainly:  Captain Benwick.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,\" (in a deep tone,)\\r\\n\"it was not done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our\\r\\nwalking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought\\r\\nthen--but no matter.  This was drawn at the Cape.  He met with\\r\\na clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise\\r\\nto my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;\\r\\nand I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!\\r\\nIt was a commission to me!  But who else was there to employ?\\r\\nI hope I can allow for him.  I am not sorry, indeed, to make it\\r\\nover to another.  He undertakes it;\" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,)\\r\\n\"he is writing about it now.\"  And with a quivering lip he wound up\\r\\nthe whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily believe.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Harville smiled, as much as to say, \"Do you claim that\\r\\nfor your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also,\\r\\n\"Yes.  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.\\r\\nIt is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.\\r\\nWe live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.\\r\\nYou are forced on exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits,\\r\\nbusiness of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,\\r\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\r\\n(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply\\r\\nto Benwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace\\r\\nturned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,\\r\\nin our little family circle, ever since.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"True,\" said Anne, \"very true; I did not recollect; but what shall\\r\\nwe say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from\\r\\noutward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,\\r\\nman\\'s nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, no, it is not man\\'s nature.  I will not allow it to be more\\r\\nman\\'s nature than woman\\'s to be inconstant and forget those they do love,\\r\\nor have loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy\\r\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\\r\\nthe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,\\r\\nand riding out the heaviest weather.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same spirit\\r\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.\\r\\nMan is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\\r\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\\r\\nNay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.\\r\\nYou have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.\\r\\nYou are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\\r\\nYour home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,\\r\\nnor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed\"\\r\\n(with a faltering voice), \"if woman\\'s feelings were to be\\r\\nadded to all this.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville\\r\\nwas beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention\\r\\nto Captain Wentworth\\'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.\\r\\nIt was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was\\r\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined\\r\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\r\\noccupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think\\r\\nhe could have caught.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Have you finished your letter?\" said Captain Harville.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.\\r\\nI am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied,\\r\\nand want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,\"\\r\\n(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree,\\r\\nI suppose, upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.\\r\\nBut let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,\\r\\nprose and verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you\\r\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think\\r\\nI ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\r\\nupon woman\\'s inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk\\r\\nof woman\\'s fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all\\r\\nwritten by men.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples\\r\\nin books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\\r\\nEducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has\\r\\nbeen in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"But how shall we prove anything?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.\\r\\nIt is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\\r\\nWe each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;\\r\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\r\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances\\r\\n(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such\\r\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,\\r\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,\\r\\n\"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\r\\na last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat\\r\\nthat he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,\\r\\nand then turns away and says, \\'God knows whether we ever meet again!\\'\\r\\nAnd then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\r\\nsee them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth\\'s absence,\\r\\nperhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon\\r\\nit be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,\\r\\nand saying, \\'They cannot be here till such a day,\\' but all the while\\r\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,\\r\\nas if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!\\r\\nIf I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,\\r\\nand glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!\\r\\nI speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\" pressing his own\\r\\nwith emotion.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you,\\r\\nand by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should undervalue\\r\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!\\r\\nI should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment\\r\\nand constancy were known only by woman.  No, I believe you capable\\r\\nof everything great and good in your married lives.  I believe you equal\\r\\nto every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,\\r\\nso long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have\\r\\nan object.  I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.\\r\\nAll the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;\\r\\nyou need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence\\r\\nor when hope is gone.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart\\r\\nwas too full, her breath too much oppressed.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand\\r\\non her arm, quite affectionately.  \"There is no quarrelling with you.\\r\\nAnd when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTheir attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking leave.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,\" said she.\\r\\n\"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.\\r\\nTo-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\"\\r\\n(turning to Anne.)  \"We had your sister\\'s card yesterday,\\r\\nand I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it;\\r\\nand you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\\r\\ncould not or would not answer fully.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but Harville and I\\r\\nshall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,\\r\\nI am in half a minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.\\r\\nI shall be at your service in half a minute.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter\\r\\nwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,\\r\\nagitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how\\r\\nto understand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\"\\r\\nfrom Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!\\r\\nHe had passed out of the room without a look!\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where\\r\\nhe had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;\\r\\nthe door opened, it was himself.  He begged their pardon,\\r\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room\\r\\nto the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,\\r\\nplaced it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\r\\nfor a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,\\r\\nalmost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it:\\r\\nthe work of an instant!\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost\\r\\nbeyond expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible,\\r\\nto \"Miss A. E.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding\\r\\nso hastily.  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,\\r\\nhe had been also addressing her!  On the contents of that letter\\r\\ndepended all which this world could do for her.  Anything was possible,\\r\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had\\r\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection\\r\\nshe must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,\\r\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,\\r\\nher eyes devoured the following words:\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means\\r\\nas are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony,\\r\\nhalf hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings\\r\\nare gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart\\r\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years\\r\\nand a half ago.  Dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman,\\r\\nthat his love has an earlier death.  I have loved none but you.\\r\\nUnjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,\\r\\nbut never inconstant.  You alone have brought me to Bath.\\r\\nFor you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not seen this?\\r\\nCan you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not waited even\\r\\nthese ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have\\r\\npenetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant hearing\\r\\nsomething which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can\\r\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\\r\\nToo good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.\\r\\nYou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.\\r\\nBelieve it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither,\\r\\nor follow your party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look,\\r\\nwill be enough to decide whether I enter your father\\'s house\\r\\nthis evening or never.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half an hour\\'s solitude\\r\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only\\r\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints\\r\\nof her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  Every moment\\r\\nrather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering happiness.\\r\\nAnd before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,\\r\\nCharles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\r\\nan immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.\\r\\nShe began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged\\r\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see\\r\\nthat she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not\\r\\nstir without her for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only\\r\\nhave gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\r\\nit would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or\\r\\nwaiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,\\r\\nshe said she would go home.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly,\\r\\nand take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.\\r\\nI wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.\\r\\nCharles, ring and order a chair.  She must not walk.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nBut the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility\\r\\nof speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,\\r\\nsolitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)\\r\\ncould not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,\\r\\nand Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,\\r\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall\\r\\nin the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,\\r\\nand got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having\\r\\nhad no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on\\r\\nfinding her better at night.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I am afraid, ma\\'am, that it is not perfectly understood.\\r\\nPray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\r\\nto see your whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been\\r\\nsome mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville\\r\\nand Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.\\r\\nCaptain Harville has no thought but of going.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.\\r\\nWill you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?\\r\\nYou will see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain Harville\\r\\nanywhere, remember to give Miss Anne\\'s message.  But indeed, my dear,\\r\\nyou need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,\\r\\nI\\'ll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance\\r\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting,\\r\\nhowever.  Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself,\\r\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\r\\nby Captain Harville.  Another momentary vexation occurred.\\r\\nCharles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;\\r\\nthere was no preventing him.  This was almost cruel.  But she could not\\r\\nbe long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith\\'s,\\r\\nto be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling\\r\\nbut gratitude apparent.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThey were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something\\r\\nof familiar sound, gave her two moments\\' preparation for the sight\\r\\nof Captain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute\\r\\nwhether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.\\r\\nAnne could command herself enough to receive that look,\\r\\nand not repulsively.  The cheeks which had been pale now glowed,\\r\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided.  He walked by her side.\\r\\nPresently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street,\\r\\nor farther up the town?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?\\r\\nBecause, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you\\r\\nto take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father\\'s door.\\r\\nShe is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,\\r\\nand I ought to be at that fellow\\'s in the Market Place.\\r\\nHe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;\\r\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,\\r\\nthat I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.\\r\\nBy his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,\\r\\nwhich you shot with one day round Winthrop.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere could not be an objection.  There could be only the most\\r\\nproper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;\\r\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.\\r\\nIn half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again,\\r\\nand the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed\\r\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\r\\nand retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make\\r\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all\\r\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\r\\ncould bestow.  There they exchanged again those feelings\\r\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,\\r\\nbut which had been followed by so many, many years of division\\r\\nand estrangement.  There they returned again into the past,\\r\\nmore exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when\\r\\nit had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed\\r\\nin a knowledge of each other\\'s character, truth, and attachment;\\r\\nmore equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as they slowly\\r\\npaced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,\\r\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\\r\\nflirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\\r\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in\\r\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,\\r\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little\\r\\nvariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday\\r\\nand today there could scarcely be an end.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nShe had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been\\r\\nthe retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate\\r\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned,\\r\\nafter a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him\\r\\nin everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,\\r\\nin the last four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding\\r\\nto the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions\\r\\noccasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by\\r\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\r\\nwith Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which\\r\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOf what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\\r\\nHe persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been supplanted.\\r\\nHe never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus much indeed\\r\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,\\r\\nnay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it\\r\\nto be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only\\r\\nbeen angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been\\r\\na sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on his mind\\r\\nas perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\r\\nand gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross\\r\\nhad he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun\\r\\nto understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons\\r\\nof more than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot\\r\\nhad at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at\\r\\nCaptain Harville\\'s had fixed her superiority.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIn his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove\\r\\n(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever\\r\\nfelt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,\\r\\nfor Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection\\r\\nwhich followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence\\r\\nof the mind with which Louisa\\'s could so ill bear a comparison,\\r\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.\\r\\nThere, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\r\\nand the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness\\r\\nand the resolution of a collected mind.  There he had seen everything\\r\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun\\r\\nto deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,\\r\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nFrom that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner\\r\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\r\\nof Louisa\\'s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,\\r\\nthan he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!\\r\\nThat neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\r\\nmutual attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree,\\r\\nI could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect\\r\\nthat others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,\\r\\nperhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour\\r\\nif she wished it.  I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously\\r\\non this subject before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\r\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had\\r\\nno right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls,\\r\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other\\r\\nill effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;\\r\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\r\\nfor Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,\\r\\nif her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.\\r\\nIt determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.\\r\\nHe would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or\\r\\nspeculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,\\r\\nto his brother\\'s, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,\\r\\nand act as circumstances might require.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.\\r\\nI could have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you\\r\\nvery particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,\\r\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder\\r\\nfor a reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured,\\r\\nin her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm\\r\\nof earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\r\\nto Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be\\r\\nthe result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHe had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,\\r\\nand the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa\\r\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\r\\nwith Benwick.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least\\r\\nput myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;\\r\\nI could do something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction,\\r\\nand waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first\\r\\nfive minutes I said, \\'I will be at Bath on Wednesday,\\' and I was.\\r\\nWas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive\\r\\nwith some degree of hope?  You were single.  It was possible that\\r\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement\\r\\nhappened to be mine.  I could never doubt that you would be loved and\\r\\nsought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man,\\r\\nat least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help\\r\\noften saying, \\'Was this for me?\\'\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nTheir first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,\\r\\nbut the concert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up\\r\\nof exquisite moments.  The moment of her stepping forward\\r\\nin the Octagon Room to speak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot\\'s appearing\\r\\nand tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,\\r\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on\\r\\nwith energy.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be\\r\\nmy well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\\r\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\\r\\nTo consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\r\\nto influence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,\\r\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his!  Was it not enough\\r\\nto make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look on\\r\\nwithout agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,\\r\\nwas not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,\\r\\nthe indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once\\r\\ndone--was it not all against me?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne.  \"You should not have\\r\\nsuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\\r\\nIf I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that\\r\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.\\r\\nWhen I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called\\r\\nin aid here.  In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk\\r\\nwould have been incurred, and all duty violated.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not.\\r\\nI could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired\\r\\nof your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\\r\\nburied, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\\r\\nyear after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded,\\r\\nwho had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\\r\\nI saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.\\r\\nI had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  The force of habit\\r\\nwas to be added.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I should have thought,\" said Anne, \"that my manner to yourself\\r\\nmight have spared you much or all of this.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\r\\nto another man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet,\\r\\nI was determined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning,\\r\\nand I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAt last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\\r\\ncould have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other\\r\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,\\r\\nshe re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\r\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.\\r\\nAn interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective\\r\\nof everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went\\r\\nto her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\r\\nof her enjoyment.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.\\r\\nIt was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had\\r\\nnever met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,\\r\\ntoo numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found\\r\\nan evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,\\r\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,\\r\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.\\r\\nMr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\\r\\nThe Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple\\r\\nand Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.\\r\\nShe cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in\\r\\nthe public manners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves,\\r\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville,\\r\\nthe kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,\\r\\nattempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;\\r\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and\\r\\nfervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;\\r\\nand with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications\\r\\ncontinually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always\\r\\nthe knowledge of his being there.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied\\r\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially\\r\\nto judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself;\\r\\nand I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it,\\r\\nthat I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\r\\nyou will love better than you do now.  To me, she was in the place\\r\\nof a parent.  Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying\\r\\nthat she did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those cases\\r\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;\\r\\nand for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance\\r\\nof tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean, that I was right\\r\\nin submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have\\r\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up,\\r\\nbecause I should have suffered in my conscience.

But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.\\r\\nI trust to being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been\\r\\nthinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,\\r\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\r\\neven than that lady?  My own self.  Tell me if, when I returned\\r\\nto England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,\\r\\nand was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you,\\r\\nwould you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short,\\r\\nhave renewed the engagement then?\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Would I!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n\"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would!  It is not that I did not think of it,\\r\\nor desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;\\r\\nbut I was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.\\r\\nI shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.\\r\\nThis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\r\\nsooner than myself.  Six years of separation and suffering\\r\\nmight have been spared.  It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.\\r\\nI have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\r\\nevery blessing that I enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils\\r\\nand just rewards.  Like other great men under reverses,\" he added,\\r\\nwith a smile. \"I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.\\r\\nI must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.\"\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<A NAME=\"chap24\"></A>\\r\\n<H3 ALIGN=\"center\">\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n</H3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nWho can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people\\r\\ntake it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance\\r\\nto carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,\\r\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each other\\'s ultimate comfort.\\r\\nThis may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth;\\r\\nand if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and\\r\\nan Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,\\r\\nconsciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,\\r\\nfail of bearing down every opposition?  They might in fact,\\r\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was\\r\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.\\r\\nSir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse\\r\\nthan look cold and unconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty\\r\\nthousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\r\\ncould place him, was no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy\\r\\nto address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,\\r\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\r\\nin the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could\\r\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\r\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nSir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne,\\r\\nand no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,\\r\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary,\\r\\nwhen he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,\\r\\nand eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,\\r\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\r\\nagainst her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by\\r\\nhis well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen,\\r\\nwith a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage\\r\\nin the volume of honour.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite\\r\\nany serious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell\\r\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot,\\r\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,\\r\\nand do justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what\\r\\nLady Russell had now to do.  She must learn to feel that she had\\r\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced\\r\\nby appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth\\'s manners\\r\\nhad not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them\\r\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because\\r\\nMr Elliot\\'s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\r\\nand correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been\\r\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\r\\nopinions and well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less\\r\\nfor Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been\\r\\npretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions\\r\\nand of hopes.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\\r\\nof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience\\r\\nin others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted\\r\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend.  But she was\\r\\na very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible\\r\\nand well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne\\r\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness\\r\\nof the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself\\r\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nOf all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\r\\nby the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married,\\r\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\r\\nto the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn;\\r\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husband\\'s sisters,\\r\\nit was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than\\r\\neither Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer,\\r\\nperhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored\\r\\nto the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;\\r\\nbut she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.\\r\\nAnne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,\\r\\nno headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth\\r\\nfrom being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\r\\nwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.\\r\\nShe had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw,\\r\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\r\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nThe news of his cousin Anne\\'s engagement burst on Mr Elliot\\r\\nmost unexpectedly.  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,\\r\\nhis best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness\\r\\nwhich a son-in-law\\'s rights would have given.  But, though discomfited\\r\\nand disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest\\r\\nand his own enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay\\'s\\r\\nquitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established\\r\\nunder his protection in London, it was evident how double a game\\r\\nhe had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself\\r\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman, at least.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Clay\\'s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,\\r\\nfor the young man\\'s sake, the possibility of scheming longer\\r\\nfor Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well as affections;\\r\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,\\r\\nmay finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being\\r\\nthe wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\r\\ninto making her the wife of Sir William.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nIt cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked\\r\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of\\r\\ntheir deception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure,\\r\\nto resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter\\r\\nand follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,\\r\\nis but a state of half enjoyment.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nAnne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell\\'s meaning\\r\\nto love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy\\r\\nto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness\\r\\nof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\\r\\nThere she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion\\r\\nin their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment\\'s regret;\\r\\nbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,\\r\\nnothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer\\r\\nin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\\r\\nin his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain\\r\\nas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise\\r\\nstrong felicity.  She had but two friends in the world to add to his list,\\r\\nLady Russell and Mrs Smith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed\\r\\nto attach himself.  Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,\\r\\nhe could now value from his heart.  While he was not obliged to say\\r\\nthat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,\\r\\nhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,\\r\\nand as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her\\r\\nquickly and permanently.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nHer recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves,\\r\\nand their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,\\r\\nsecured her two.  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life;\\r\\nand Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering\\r\\nher husband\\'s property in the West Indies, by writing for her,\\r\\nacting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\\r\\nof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\\r\\nand a determined friend, fully requited the services which\\r\\nshe had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P>\\r\\nMrs Smith\\'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,\\r\\nwith some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends\\r\\nto be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not\\r\\nfail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\\r\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.\\r\\nShe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,\\r\\nand yet be happy.  Her spring of felicity was in the glow\\r\\nof her spirits, as her friend Anne\\'s was in the warmth of her heart.\\r\\nAnne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it\\r\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s affection.  His profession was all that could ever\\r\\nmake her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war\\r\\nall that could dim her sunshine.  She gloried in being a sailor\\'s wife,\\r\\nbut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession\\r\\nwhich is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues\\r\\nthan in its national importance.\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<P CLASS=\"finis\">\\r\\nFinis\\r\\n</P>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR><BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<pre>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Persuasion, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PERSUASION ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 105-h.htm or 105-h.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/105/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Sharon Partridge and Martin Ward.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n\\r\\n</BODY>\\r\\n\\r\\n</HTML>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
